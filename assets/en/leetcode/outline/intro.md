# 1.1 Data Structures and Algorithms

Firstly, let's clarify the definitions of data structures and algorithms.

Broadly speaking, data structures refer to the storage structures of a set of data, and algorithms are a set of methods to manipulate data.

In a narrow sense, which is the focus of this book, it refers to certain classical data structures and algorithms, such as queues, stacks, heaps, binary search, dynamic programming, and more. These are abstractions derived from practical operational scenarios by predecessors, proven and tested extensively to efficiently help us solve real-world development problems.

What an "algorithm engineer" does in terms of "algorithms" is entirely different from the "algorithms" in "data structures and algorithms."

For the former, the emphasis is on mathematical modeling and tuning experience, with the computer being just a tool for calculations. For the latter, the focus is on computational thinking, requiring you to stand in the perspective of the computer, abstract and simplify real-world problems, and then solve them using appropriate data structures.

## How to Learn

The content covered by data structures and algorithms is extensive. How can one efficiently and systematically learn it?

You don't need to master all the knowledge points illustrated in the diagram. Many advanced data structures and algorithms, such as bipartite graphs and maximum flow, are rarely used in our everyday development.

I have summarized 20 of the most commonly used and fundamental data structures and algorithms. Whether for interviews or job requirements, concentrating on conquering these 20 knowledge points is sufficient.

I have provided in-depth explanations for each knowledge point, along with corresponding LeetCode problems to help you establish a solid foundation and form your own knowledge system.

For a more comprehensive understanding of data structures and algorithms, you can refer to this mind map, which covers almost all the knowledge points found in books on data structures and algorithms.

## How to Solve Problems

Although there are many LeetCode problems, when categorized, there aren't that many, and many problems share similar patterns and extensions.

For students with a weak foundation in computer science, if you follow the high-frequency order to solve problems and gain knowledge from each problem, this method is not without merit. However, it may not be very efficient and could lead to fragmented knowledge without a holistic understanding.

I recommend adopting a systematic learning method of "**Categorized Learning** + **Core Problems** + **Repetitive Training** + **Comprehensive Mastery**."

I have organized [**Top 150 Classic Interview Questions**](./plan/top_150_list.md) and [**Top 200 High-Frequency Interview Questions**](./plan/top_200_list.md). It is suggested to start with these problems, practice by category, click on the title to jump to the corresponding LeetCode question page, and click on the solution (JS) to view my problem-solving approach and code. If you encounter unfamiliar concepts, you can refer to the corresponding in-depth explanation.

Once you grasp the basic principles and approaches of these ten or so common algorithm types, you will have a general understanding of data structures and algorithms. Even when facing many new problems, you can often use your existing knowledge to tackle them.

After initially understanding algorithm templates and data structures, you can further practice with [**CodeTop Hot Questions Ranking**](./plan/codetop_list.md), [**Overseas Rabbit Hot Questions Ranking**](./plan/rabbit_list.md), [**Popular Company Question Bank**](./plan/company_list.md), and [**LeetCode Solutions**](./solution_list.md). Gradually enhance your mastery of problem-solving strategies and insights into the underlying principles.

Success often comes from **repeating simple, correct tasks**, rather than believing in or pursuing a magical one-time winning formula.

To conquer LeetCode, there is no magical method. The most important thing is to roll up your sleeves and solve problems yourself.

Spending more time contemplating how to solve the problems at hand and less time fantasizing about progress bars can lead to success.
