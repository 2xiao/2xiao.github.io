# Three Dimensions for Choosing an Immigration Country

<font color=gray>Published on 2023-06-27</font>

In summary, there are three dimensions or indicators when choosing a country for immigration.

They are: job opportunities, social systems, and the difficulty of buying a house.

This order also represents their prioritization.

Firstly, one must be able to find a job locally. In some places, even though housing prices are low, if you can't find a job, it's futile. The only exception is the situation for digital nomads, which is currently not considered.

The second indicator is the social system, encompassing various aspects such as the robustness of the legal system and societal fairness. This significantly impacts the experience of working.

The third indicator is the difficulty of buying a house, a more supplementary factor.

Let's first discuss the first indicator, job opportunities. Basically, countries like the United States, Canada, China, and some European countries can meet the criteria, offering ample job opportunities.

However, concerning the second indicator, social systems, I currently believe that the Western world surpasses China. Western countries tend to have more robust legal systems, societal fairness, inclusivity, and respect for individual rights.

On the third indicator, the difficulty of purchasing a house, the United States slightly surpasses Canada, Europe, and China.

Living in Europe, which also represents a Western society—countries like the Netherlands and Germany, for instance, offers many job opportunities and the potential for a joyful life. However, the per capita living space may be somewhat smaller.

As for North American countries, the United States, compared to Canada, has the advantage of greater geographical depth. The vast land allows for a diverse range of experiences—from thriving on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley to residing peacefully in the countryside, enjoying a secluded paradise. Additionally, the United States offers more options in terms of locations compared to Canada.

Therefore, the conclusion is that, considering these three indicators, the United States is currently the optimal choice.

- **United States:** Affordable housing, high salaries, excellent education, large homes per capita. However, there's the challenge of dealing with immigration procedures, a low H1B approval rate, and a 4-year waiting period for green cards.
- **Canada:** Toronto and Vancouver have relatively high housing prices, while Edmonton offers lower prices. Salaries are slightly lower than in the United States. Canada is friendly to skilled immigrants, and the process of obtaining a Maple Leaf card is relatively straightforward.
- **Europe:** Residency is relatively easy to obtain. As long as you find a job and meet the required duration, permanent residency is attainable. Specific European countries include:
  - **Switzerland:** Challenging due to job scarcity, but if secured, offers the highest salaries.
  - **UK, France, Germany, Netherlands:** Good work-life balance, many large companies, but housing is expensive, and salaries are lower.

Personally, I lean towards staying in the United States because it's more familiar. Even if I lose some freedom, I don't want to face the unknown and the fear it brings.

However, today I watched a video where the creator expressed it well. Faced with the unknown, whether you see it as an opportunity and adventure or as a risk and fear depends entirely on your mentality.

Life is genuinely unpredictable, and all I can do is face the unknown.

My approach is to consider it an opportunity, a challenge, an adventure.

This isn't a risk; this isn't fear.

This statement reminded me of a girl I met in Yichang last year. She looked a lot like Wu Xuanyi and had quit her job for a year. She said she wasn't planning to buy a house or get married, enjoying the feeling of always being on the road.

I asked her how she copes with this sense of wandering.

She said, "Don't think of yourself as wandering; think of it as traveling."

We can completely view ourselves as global citizens, travel around the world, live in different countries for a few years, free ourselves from the constraints of money, status, and housing, and perhaps reduce the shackles a bit.
