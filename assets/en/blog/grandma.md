# Grandma and Her House

<font color=gray>Published on 2021-12-26</font>

I recently read a book titled "Grandma and Her House," a fascinating memoir narrated by Shen Yifei's mother and written by Shen Yifei's daughter. It recounts the life journey of her mother, born in 1952, from childhood, participating in collective production teams to earn work points, dealing with the challenges of living with her mother-in-law after marriage, nurturing her daughter to get into Fudan University, living in a small apartment in Shanghai with her daughter and son-in-law, to buying a house, renovating, and eventually moving to a large duplex. The story is vividly written and captivating. I finished it in just a day and a half, and it was so engaging that even my dreams at night were filled with stories from the era of reform and opening up.

Grandma's life in the collective production team during the People's Commune movement left a deep impression on me. It was the first time I realized how hard farm work was, requiring not only physical strength but also skills. In that era, the demands for agricultural work were extremely high. Labor not only directly affected the yield but also represented the individual's quality and enthusiasm for the work. Everyone knew each other's abilities very well. So, as a member of the Communist Youth League, Grandma had to work diligently. During the busy seasons of harvesting double-season rice, she slept only four hours a day, and her feet developed calluses and inflammation, oozing with pus, yet she persisted in working in the fields.

Perhaps people nowadays would think my mindset back then was foolish, assuming that there must be something wrong with a person who disregards their own well-being. However, this was a prevalent mindset of that eraâ€”self-sacrifice, with the cadres leading the way.

This reminds me of my grandmother, who also worked tirelessly. When she was building a house, she accidentally rolled into a bonfire and got burned. Her wounds had not healed, but she ignored advice and went to work in the fields. Unfortunately, she encountered heavy rain, her wounds got wet, became infected, and she ended up suffering from illnesses for the rest of her life.

I used to not understand why she would ignore her health like that. It was clear that whether she worked a little more or less, it was just a matter of recording labor points, with no KPI pressure. It wasn't until I read this book that I gained a deeper understanding of my grandmother's story. At the same time, I feel a great regret as my grandparents are no longer alive, and I no longer have the opportunity to ask them about their young days.

During the era of managing production teams, although one could slack off and still earn work points, everyone had a sense of responsibility. People cared a lot about their evaluation within the collective and their contribution to the community.

During that era, there was a strong sense of mission tied to values. Anything honorable and valuable, no matter how tough or meaningless it seemed, attracted millions to dedicate themselves as if honor could feed them. Therefore, when Grandma thought about serving comrades in the whole village, she felt motivated. She worked very hard, and the villagers recognized and liked her.

Reading this section, to be honest, I was deeply moved. The People's Commune movement happened only 50 years ago, but the social rules and values faced by the people on the same land have completely changed.

It's hard for us to imagine that 50 years ago, houses and jobs were assigned, there were no ration coupons, even if you had money, you couldn't buy food. Selfless dedication and doing good deeds were pursuits of everyone. Grandma could not have imagined that 50 years later, young people would no longer endure the elements while working in the fields. Food and goods would be abundant, and people would have no worries about clothing and food, yet still, they might not be happy.

Today's generation born in the '90s and 2000s, holding salaries tens of times higher than the per capita income, still feels uncertain about the future. Some have bought rundown houses after working for a lifetime and obtained Beijing hukou through point accumulation. Some were born with it. After ten years of studying hard, getting into a top-tier university, studying advanced mathematics and quantum mechanics, they end up developing animations for WeChat ðŸ’© and beauty filters for TikTok after graduation. Faced with the dilemma of a small bed in a big city, they either shoulder a 30-year mortgage, risking unemployment at the age of 35, or reluctantly take a stable job in their hometown where they can see the end.

Yet, Grandma, despite experiencing poverty, hunger, and hardship, found a sense of mission and value in her work. It was glorious and meaningful, and recalling it in old age brings her joy. Happiness and meaning are precisely what our generation lacks the most.

This also reinforces my belief: life is a game, and everyone else is an NPC.

For each of us, everyone else in the world is essentially an NPC.

Imagine if you were to play a game, and you could only play it once. Would you care about what NPCs say or do in the game? Your thoughts and goals would undoubtedly be to explore the game, see how it can be played. Even if NPCs in the game say offensive things or discourage you, how much emotional response can it trigger? Would you care about what NPCs in the game are doing? Additionally, the achievements you unlock in the game (or the items and properties you lose) are only meaningful in the game. Once you step out of the game, these achievements have no significance. Regardless of your level as a player or how many in-game coins you have, they are just things in the game.

Similarly, any achievements in our world actually lose their meaning in a higher dimension.

Due to the progression of history, those born in the '90s and 2000s may inevitably experience the hardships of moving from small towns to big cities, the struggles of climbing the social ladder, and the drudgery of the 996 work culture.

However, can we only play this game according to mainstream rules? Is there a path that few have taken, one that is quiet but more tempting and beautiful?
