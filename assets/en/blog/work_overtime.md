# On Overtime and Overwork Culture

Last month, I experienced a night of overtime work.

I remember that evening I was at home watching "Green Book" when suddenly the WeChat group exploded. It seemed to be a segment of code stuck in a loop, causing a platform at the company to crash. The leaders said the consequences were severe!

I had no time to care about the Oscars. I quickly opened my computer and joined my colleagues in debugging. By the time we finished the remote rollback, fixing, and deployment, it was already 1 a.m. I thought it was over, but the platform monitoring still showed that the looping issue was not completely resolved.

At that moment, I was in a state of intense focus, as if facing a life-or-death situation. Despite the late hour, there was no trace of sleepiness. I thought, tonight I won't be able to get a good night's sleep. Since I lived closest to the office among my colleagues, I decided to go back to the office. I put on my thickest down jacket, grabbed my toothbrush and eye cream, and took a taxi back to the office to continue debugging.

Finally, after a night of troubleshooting through variable exclusion, the problem was resolved. From the incident report the next day, it wasn't as severe as we initially feared. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

I still remember myself that night. Although I felt a bit uncomfortable after staying up all night, my dark circles became more prominent, and a bottle of eye cream went to waste, my emotions weren't complaints or fatigue. There was no blame for the person who wrote the bug. Instead, I felt oddly happy. If I were to quantify it, it was probably ten times the joy of drinking a cheese tea!

I found it strange, why was I happy?

Later, I understood. Although I claimed not to care about being at the bottom of the team, deep down, I still harbored a fear of the company's assessment system. After sacrificing my health for an all-nighter, I felt recognized by others. I felt considerate and responsible. I felt that the attitude of the leaders towards me had improved. So, I temporarily escaped from fear, felt relieved, and was particularly happy.

People often say life is tough, but, in fact, it's us being unkind to ourselves. We are adept at punishing ourselves for our own or others' mistakes, sometimes unconsciously. I had not realized that I lived under significant pressure every day. I didn't notice that I deliberately punished myself to alleviate inner fear and anxiety.

From "My Mad Fat Diary":
“The real violence, the violence I realized was unforgivable, is the violence that we do to ourselves, when we're too afraid to be who we really are.”

In the education I received and the novels and TV shows I've seen, "enduring hardship" is always glorified.

Choosing difficulty in everything, or even creating difficulties when there are none, is a badge of honor. In the midst of these difficulties, we climb cliffs while fearing failure and abandonment, yet we take pride in enduring hardships, looking down on those who can't endure as much as we can.

It seems that an enjoyable, easy life is not worth pursuing.

It seems that we have to rely on these hardships to maintain our tottering self-esteem.

It seems that we must go through immense pain to enjoy; otherwise, it's decadence.

Recently, I've been listening to "Human Nature Has Cracks: 52 Lessons on Understanding Personality" on Simple Psychology. It talks about masochistic personality.

Psychologists divide "self-infliction" into two categories: moral masochism and relational masochism.

Moral masochists willingly endure suffering to gain a sense of moral victory. Freud said these people endure pain purposefully: "Only if I endure enough, suffer enough, can I be a 'good person' worthy of love."

Think about the stories on the school radio about mothers loving fish heads, the portrayal of "good wives" and "big sisters" in TV dramas, and the recent hit drama "Su Mingyu." All of them tell stories of sacrificing everything for others, even if you've been bullied before, I can dedicate my all, give up my family, and abandon my job for you.

The second type is relational masochism, defined as maintaining emotional or interpersonal relationships at any cost and defining oneself through relationships with others.

"The belief of a relational masochist is, I can change, I can sacrifice, I can do anything, just please don't leave me, please keep liking me. As long as you don't leave me, I feel that I exist."

"Holding on to relationships at any cost. I'll sell my flesh and blood to maintain our relationship; otherwise, I'll feel worthless."

"In relationships with others, everything about me is negotiable."

Of course, the above is just a record and does not mean that I consider myself to have a masochistic personality. Once again, to reiterate Charlie Munger's words, when you have a hammer in your hand, everything looks like a nail. Also, I think learning about psychology and its definitions of various personalities is an efficient way of collecting samples.

In our growth, we've all had experiences of yielding to others, sacrificing our needs to take care of others. These "mature" behaviors receive high moral praise. Often, such encouragement and support make a child feel that "pain" is the necessary cost to obtain intimacy and love.

The Bible says, "Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them."

Although overtime is still necessary, it's worth stopping and asking yourself: Do you allow yourself to enjoy? Do you feel you deserve to be loved? Deep down, do you feel you are good enough?
