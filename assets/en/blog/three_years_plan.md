# Future Plans for the Next Three Years

<font color=gray>Published on 2019-04-15</font>

In January 2019, a vague sense of something important, something on the verge of emerging, began to occupy my consciousness. However, with the daily grind and tight schedules, I didn't have the time to contemplate it thoroughly. Over the next few months, I casually pondered on this matter, documenting any progress in my journal.

Yesterday, I finally managed to organize these thoughts coherently. These may be some decisions that will significantly impact my life over the next three years. Only time will tell if I can align my actions with these intentions.

### # 1 Tackling Risks Within Controllable Boundaries for Maximum Progress

At the beginning of the year, with widespread layoffs in prominent companies and rumors of senior programmers receiving low scores in year-end evaluations, the tech industry seemed uncertain. As a newcomer, I might be the first casualty. So, using statistical sampling and deductive reasoning, I predicted my next performance review. Without delving into the details, the likelihood of a low score was quite high.

Faced with this prospect, I envisioned my father's disappointment. Determined to avoid such an outcome, I initiated a tactical plan. However, the viability of these plans remains uncertain. After all, achieving the skill level of the team's seasoned experts within six months, even with relentless effort, is a challenging feat. Moreover, personal energy and creativity are limited resources, as my mentor often reminds me: "Don't deceive yourself. Don't use tactical diligence to cover up strategic laziness."

He further advised, "Capitalism doesn't provide a communal feast. There will inevitably be individuals at the bottom of the team. Although maintaining a certain elimination rate is the best team structure, a low performance score is not as severe as layoffs. In the end, it's just a matter of earning a few thousand yuan less. Don't overthink it; you can't solve it by worrying. Just perform normally."

In that moment, it felt like an epiphany. The idea that "good decisions have asymmetric return properties" flashed through my mind. The concept that a decision's wrongness has a lower limit of consequences, but its correctness brings unlimited benefits. My mentor's advice to perform normally and to seek a strategy with asymmetric returns resonated profoundly. Instead of fixating on short-term gains and losses, he encouraged long-term thinking. In three years, will my life still be significantly influenced by a single performance review? What actions taken now truly benefit my future self?

On another note, regarding "overthinking," a recent conversation with new interns prompted a realization. Their focus on the possibility of converting their internships into full-time positions seemed misplaced. Achieving full-time status is a natural progression when one dedicates themselves to learning from experienced colleagues in major companies. The prospect of conversion is laden with randomness and uncontrollables. Even graduates from prestigious institutions have a considerable chance of being hired despite their lack of competence. Employers primarily value individuals who get things done, produce outstanding results, and approach challenges with a solution-oriented mindset rather than obsessing over conversion rates.

### # 2 Embracing an Open Perspective to Play Non-Zero-Sum Games

One sleepless night in March, I read a book called "The Path of Least Resistance" by a musician. The core idea is to replace life's structural revolutions of constantly solving problems with the discipline of creativity.

While the book's main arguments seemed reasonable, I finished it quickly due to some far-fetched points. Yet, one article within it captivated me. It discussed the concept of an open mind.

"Openness" means releasing oneself from preconceptions, burdens, and psychological shadows, returning to the most authentic state. Remarkably, as you open up, the world opens up to you. Every single thing, every event, and every person in the world becomes more authentic.

In habitual thinking, the world is closed. Your connection with things is fixed and single-threaded. This inevitably leads to an incomplete understanding, akin to blind men feeling an elephant, each at a different part. Yet, once you open yourself, a holographic and comprehensive connection is established. Aspects previously unseen emerge, numerous novel ideas surface, and the infinite possibilities between you and things become apparent.

In the author's words, "'Emptiness' doesn't refer to vacuity and hollowness; it means clearing away prejudices, biases, restrictions, and psychological shadows. Afterward, the inner self becomes clear and transparent, returning to a state of freedom and authenticity. In this state, free from possessiveness and attachment, one has ambition and focus. Creativity is sparked, new connections and worlds, previously unnoticed, unfold. Find the path of least resistance."

For some reason, as I read these lines, I felt like I was suddenly elevated, possessing a panoramic view of many people and events in life. Current circumstances and emotions condensed into a glass marble, held in my hand for careful observation. I suddenly understood the motivations and situations of cooperation-oriented products and grassroots managers at the company. I realized that work is not a confrontation, and a problem-solving mindset is inappropriate for sharpening the sword and rushing into battle.

Problem-solving places the problem against you, transforming it into a zero-sum game. On the contrary, nonlinear thinking shifts attention to creating, avoiding the hard confrontation with problems. It focuses on pursuing mutual gains and playing a non-zero-sum game.

This book also led me to reconsider the concept of weight loss.

Firstly, as the most fundamental desire in life, confronting appetite head-on with willpower is often futile. Furthermore, I gradually understood that how you live today will likely be how you live forty years from now. The idea that "if I do this, I will become that" is a fallacy. Sustainable changes are nonexistent. So, gradually changing lifestyle and eating habits, within controllable bounds, is a more achievable approach.

### # 3 Becoming an Artist and Making Creation the Main Theme of Life

(Excerpts from the podcast "Got Carried Away")

What is the core essence of an artist?

Firstly, the artist's mission is to express the self through works of art.

Creation is the process of exploring the underlying rules of the world. To create something from 0 to 1, one must understand it deeply from an internal perspective. The creative process forces deep reflection, a valuable state and process.

Creation is not limited by form—whether it's realizing a product in a startup, sculpting, composing a song, writing an article, creating a vlog, or even preparing a meal, it can all be considered creation.

Secondly, another core goal of an artist is to explore the self.

There are two criteria for creation: it must be the result of careful consideration, and it must be the result of making the most effort to be honest with oneself.

In Buddhist terms, it is about the "aspiration" behind an action. If you seek and discover yourself, or even change yourself during the process, you are engaged in creation.

Lastly, most artists are somewhat impoverished.

This doesn't mean poverty is a prerequisite for being an artist. Rather, one can reframe the mindset. Consider making creation the main theme of life, viewing regular work (

day job) as a source of income and a means of supporting creative endeavors, using an artist's standards to evaluate oneself.

Being an artist may sound ludicrous or even absurd. Initially, I didn't pay much attention to this statement. However, upon reconsideration, I suddenly realized that I am unequivocally an artist!

It feels like the protagonist Jordan in Molière's novel "The Bourgeois Gentleman," who, upon learning the definition of "prose," exclaims in astonishment, "Think about it, I've been speaking prose my whole life without knowing it."

I don't know how long this phase will last, but tonight's breeze feels remarkably cool.
