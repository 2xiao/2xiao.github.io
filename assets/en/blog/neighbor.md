# Helping a Neighbor Move in the U.S.

<font color=gray>Published on 2023-05-17</font>

Today, I helped the neighbor upstairs move and took the opportunity to visit their new large house.

It's a three-story townhouse. The first floor has the living room and garage, the bottom floor has a home theater and a yard, and the second floor has the master bedroom and two guest bedrooms.

Located in a safe and nice area in Atlanta, this kind of townhouse is priced at around $600,000, including brand-new furnishings and appliances (they even got a $12,000 refrigerator for free). The down payment is estimated to be around $200,000 to $300,000.

The neighbor upstairs is named Kaz, of Japanese descent. He immigrated to the U.S. with his mother when he was one year old and grew up happily. He excels in various sports, with tennis and frisbee at a coaching level, which he used to play frequently in college.

He used to command aircraft takeoffs and landings in the Air Force, and the atmosphere was relaxed, with jokes flying around while working. Later, fearing deployment to a war zone, he resigned. Now, he is a fitness coach. The pay isn't great, but the schedule is flexible.

His wife, Tara, is of Indian descent and exceptionally beautiful. She works as a speechwriter and article writer for a CEO, usually working from home and only needing to go to the office one day a week.

Tara's father was a first-generation immigrant who came to the U.S. for study. He married an Irish-American and obtained a green card. Eventually, he worked his way up to becoming a professor in the computer science department at a university. Their Indian family tradition is to eat only vegetarian food and not intermarry with outsiders. However, faced with U.S. immigration issues, they had to compromise, but the requirement for the couple was a lifelong vegetarian diet. Tara's mother successfully integrated into the Indian family.

I asked Kaz if his parents helped with the down payment. In China, it's common for parents to provide financial assistance when buying a house.

He said: really? that's nice. Then he said, almost no Americans have their parents do that, and besides, his parents are very poor, so he relied on himself entirely.

I also asked him if he had considered living in Japan for a while.

He said Japan is too crowded, with everyone crammed into small houses in the cities. He prefers the spacious feeling of the United States.

It seems that Americans have very little life pressure. They can casually go to school, spend most of their time doing sports and physical activities with friends. When it comes to work, they can find a job casually. A job with a stable income is something they can quit if they want to. Being a fitness coach pays okay, but more importantly, it offers flexible working hours. Buying a house after working for a few years, and it's a large house! In China, only the top 1% of people could afford such a house, but in the U.S., it's a basic operation for the middle class.

It reminded me of a metaphor by Liang Yong'an:

**People are like trees. Don't live in the dark valleys; strive to elevate yourself, competing with other trees for sunlight.**

**Don't live on the mountaintop, where the wind is strong, and the sun is scorching.**

**Instead, live on the mountainside, where there's ample rain, and the sunlight is just right.**

Trees don't have a choice, but people can choose the environment in which they survive.
