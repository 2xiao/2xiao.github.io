# The Indian Brother Living in the Shadows

<font color=gray>Published on 2023-07-17</font>

Today, I went to Walmart to buy groceries and decided to grab some curry goat from the Indian restaurant nearby.

While waiting for my order, I struck up a conversation with the Indian guy at the front counter. He mentioned he had been in the United States for 38 months.

Curious, I asked him how he managed to get his visa.

He casually revealed that he was actually overstaying illegally; his visa had expired.

I probed further, inquiring about his monthly earnings.

He replied, "From 10 in the morning till 11 at night, I make $3500 a month. But if you work at a place that pays hourly, the wages can be higher."

"Planning to stay here for the long term?" I asked.

He shook his head, "No, just making some money and going back."

Earning $3500 might be considered an average wage here, but working under the table means no social security contributions, exploitation of working hours, inability to obtain a driver's license, and no option to leave the country. Yet, there are still countless people willing to live in the shadows.

Some do it to earn dollars, while others do it for their children's immigration status.

Earning dollars and obtaining a green card are great, but the descent in social class is apparent.

In China, one might work as a white-collar professional or even retire comfortably, but in the United States, they might find themselves doing blue-collar jobs, flipping burgers, or working as waiters.

Living a middle-class life in China, they come to the U.S., where everything is seven times more expensive, and suddenly, everything seems costly.

I still believe that giving up freedom and quality of life for immigration status, whether it's a Beijing hukou or a green card, is a kind of obsession.

The universe's arbitrage guide is about being free and earning dollars.
