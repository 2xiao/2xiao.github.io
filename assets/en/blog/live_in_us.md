# Reflections on Living in the United States

<font color=gray>Published on 2022-09-22</font>

Recently, I spent three months in the United States, and many friends have asked me, "How's life in the U.S.?" They wanted to hear about my experiences there. So, I've summarized some personal reflections to provide insights for those with similar curiosities.

In summary: This trip to the United States allowed me to experience a lifestyle that is free, relaxed, and joyful. It also opened up my mindset, making it a truly enriching journey.

## Freedom

This is something I frequently experienced in the U.S.—it's not just a slogan but evident in many details of daily life.

For instance, there are no cameras on the roads, yet nobody runs red lights. People adhere strictly to traffic rules, stop obediently at stop signs for a few seconds, yield to pedestrians even when they are far away, and when they hear a fire truck siren, the entire road comes to a halt. It's a feeling of trust that everyone will abide by the law.

## Relaxed and Joyful Lifestyle

I often exclaim that Americans are too fortunate.

There's no 996 work culture, no intense competition.

Take Meta, for example. Most people finish work at five, go home, have dinner with their families, stroll in the park with their dogs, or stay until six to enjoy the company's free dinner. If you need to message a colleague after working hours, you'll send a silent message, meaning the recipient won't be notified unless they open the app. Team leaders share tips on work-life balance in public forums, recounting their successful experiences of taking three weeks of vacation without checking work messages.

Most Americans live in the suburbs, surrounded by nature and various wild animals. During weekends, they go hiking, drifting, swimming in pools, playing tennis, or basketball. Even dogs have dedicated parks with fitness equipment. The weather is pleasant, with no smog, and the highest temperature rarely exceeds 33℃.

Housing is usually in large houses. The size of the house seems never to be a source of anxiety. Even when renting, it's not the kind of cramped, run-down place. There's no anxiety about buying a house because renting can also provide a high-quality living experience. The rental market is mature and standardized, with every neighborhood equipped with a swimming pool, gym, and tennis court. It's common to see people driving Porsches while renting.

There's no body image anxiety in the U.S. People aren't shy about showing their bodies, and nobody cares how you dress. Nobody judges; it's all about making yourself happy.

## The World is Broad

I recently saw someone on Weibo say:

When I just started working, I talked with friends about studying abroad, job hopping, starting a business, and traveling around the world. At that time, I thought the pandemic would pass quickly. I was just temporarily staying here, waiting for the storm to calm down so I could have a broader future.

But now? I don't think about anything anymore, I dare not think. Every day I hear a hundred bad news from all directions and then appreciate my job, which will not be fired.

The seniors who told me, "Don't settle," now tell me it's good to stay here for a lifetime. It seems we have no imagination for the future anymore.

Browsing Weibo and communicating with relatives and friends in China, I do feel that many people have closed themselves off. They believe that this is how things will be in the future—helpless, resigned, and despairing. Everyone is pursuing stability, getting ashore, buying a house, making money. But even when they achieve these, it doesn't necessarily bring happiness.

I often tell myself one thing: the world is vast.

Back in China, I often got stuck in a cycle of meaninglessness. Everyone around me was working hard, with little life because working overtime was necessary for promotion, promotion was necessary for a raise, a raise was needed to buy a house, a house was necessary for children to go to school, schooling was necessary for them to attend a prestigious university, and entering a prestigious university was necessary to join a big company... It was like the story of the shepherd.

However, after coming to the U.S., I feel like I've entered a completely different world, a new game.

In this game, different currencies are used, a different language is spoken, road signs on highways are in English, people of different races live together, and there are different lifestyles.

It feels magical. The world indeed has so many ways to unfold! This sense of wonder doesn't come from specific details but from the overall narrative structure. It's like a feeling of time travel.

This also gave me a chance to "unplug," allowing me to redefine who I am.

The term "unplug" refers to a person going to a new place, where their past identity and social relationships are completely stripped away. They get to start over with a brand-new identity.

You are no longer someone's child or an employee of a certain company; you are just yourself.

Previously, your identity and what you should do were defined by your past, by others. It was defined by a whole set of social identities.

But in this drifting journey, you can, through autonomous choices, reconstruct your social relationships and redefine your identity and essence.

## Abundance

When I went to the U.S., I didn't exchange any U.S. dollars. I got off the plane with empty hands, picked up by a friend, and every day, I enjoyed free meals. Still, I experienced a lot of abundance.

It's a rather magical experience, giving me a feeling of going back to childhood when I was supported by my parents. Despite having little money back then, I had a very rich and cherished memory.

I often feel that life in the U.S. is exceptionally refreshing. Life is like playing a game. At the beginning of registration, you have nothing, but as the plot demands, you are given all the items you need, and you also earn some coins while completing tasks. However, it's not crucial to accumulate coins desperately in the game; coins are just props. What's important is to enjoy the game and have fun!
