# [25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group)

## 题目

Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a
time, and return _the modified list_.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the
linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out
nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be
changed.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
    **Output:** [2,1,4,3,5]
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex2.jpg)

    
    
    **Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
    **Output:** [3,2,1,4,5]
    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
  * `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`



**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?
