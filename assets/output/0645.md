# [645. Set Mismatch](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/)

## 题目

You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from
`1` to `n`. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got
duplicated to another number in the set, which results in **repetition of
one** number and **loss of another** number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set
after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return
_them in the form of an array_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
>
> Output: [2,3]

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,1]
>
> Output: [1,2]

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
