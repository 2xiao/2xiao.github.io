# [3280. Convert Date to Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-date-to-binary/)

## 题目

You are given a string `date` representing a Gregorian calendar date in the
`yyyy-mm-dd` format.

`date` can be written in its binary representation obtained by converting
year, month, and day to their binary representations without any leading
zeroes and writing them down in `year-month-day` format.

Return the **binary** representation of `date`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** date = "2080-02-29"

**Output:** "100000100000-10-11101"

**Explanation:**

100000100000, 10, and 11101 are the binary representations of 2080, 02, and 29
respectively.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** date = "1900-01-01"

**Output:** "11101101100-1-1"

**Explanation:**

11101101100, 1, and 1 are the binary representations of 1900, 1, and 1
respectively.

**Constraints:**

- `date.length == 10`
- `date[4] == date[7] == '-'`, and all other `date[i]`'s are digits.
- The input is generated such that `date` represents a valid Gregorian calendar date between Jan 1st, 1900 and Dec 31st, 2100 (both inclusive).
