# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

## 题目

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given
stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock
and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you
cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
> 
> Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

> Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`
