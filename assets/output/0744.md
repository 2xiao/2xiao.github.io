# [744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/)

## 题目

You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in **non-
decreasing order** , and a character `target`. There are **at least two
different** characters in `letters`.

Return _the smallest character in_`letters` _that is lexicographically greater
than_`target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character
in `letters`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
>
> Output: "c"
>
> Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.

**Example 2:**

> Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
>
> Output: "f"
>
> Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.

**Example 3:**

> Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
>
> Output: "x"
>
> Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= letters.length <= 10^4`
- `letters[i]` is a lowercase English letter.
- `letters` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
- `letters` contains at least two different characters.
- `target` is a lowercase English letter.
