# [414. Third Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the **third distinct maximum** number
in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the **maximum**
number_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [3,2,1]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation:
>
> The first distinct maximum is 3.
>
> The second distinct maximum is 2.
>
> The third distinct maximum is 1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,2]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation:
>
> The first distinct maximum is 2.
>
> The second distinct maximum is 1.
>
> The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation:
>
> The first distinct maximum is 3.
>
> The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
>
> The third distinct maximum is 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** Can you find an `O(n)` solution?
