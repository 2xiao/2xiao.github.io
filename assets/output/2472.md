# [2472. Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-palindrome-substrings/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` and a **positive** integer `k`.

Select a set of **non-overlapping** substrings from the string `s` that
satisfy the following conditions:

- The **length** of each substring is **at least** `k`.
- Each substring is a **palindrome**.

Return _the **maximum** number of substrings in an optimal selection_.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "abaccdbbd", k = 3
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: We can select the substrings underlined in s = " _ **aba**_ cc _ **dbbd**_ ". Both "aba" and "dbbd" are palindromes and have a length of at least k = 3.
>
> It can be shown that we cannot find a selection with more than two valid substrings.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "adbcda", k = 2
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: There is no palindrome substring of length at least 2 in the string.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
