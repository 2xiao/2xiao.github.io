# [2770. Maximum Number of Jumps to Reach the Last Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-jumps-to-reach-the-last-index/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer
`target`.

You are initially positioned at index `0`. In one step, you can jump from
index `i` to any index `j` such that:

  * `0 <= i < j < n`
  * `-target <= nums[j] - nums[i] <= target`

Return _the **maximum number of jumps** you can make to reach index_ `n - 1`.

If there is no way to reach index `n - 1`, return `-1`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 2
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: To go from index 0 to index n - 1 with the maximum number of jumps, you can perform the following jumping sequence:
> - Jump from index 0 to index 1. 
> - Jump from index 1 to index 3.
> - Jump from index 3 to index 5.
> 
> It can be proven that there is no other jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1 with more than 3 jumps. Hence, the answer is 3. 

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 3
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: To go from index 0 to index n - 1 with the maximum number of jumps, you can perform the following jumping sequence:
> - Jump from index 0 to index 1.
> - Jump from index 1 to index 2.
> - Jump from index 2 to index 3.
> - Jump from index 3 to index 4.
> - Jump from index 4 to index 5.
> 
> It can be proven that there is no other jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1 with more than 5 jumps. Hence, the answer is 5. 

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 0
> 
> Output: -1
> 
> Explanation: It can be proven that there is no jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1. Hence, the answer is -1. 

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length == n <= 1000`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `0 <= target <= 2 * 109`
