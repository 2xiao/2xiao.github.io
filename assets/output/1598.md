# [1598. Crawler Log Folder](https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/)

## 题目

The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a _change
folder_ operation.

The operations are described below:

- `"../"` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, **remain in the same folder** ).
- `"./"` : Remain in the same folder.
- `"x/"` : Move to the child folder named `x` (This folder is **guaranteed to always exist** ).

You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation
performed by the user at the `ith` step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are
performed.

Return _the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder
after the change folder operations._

**Example 1:**

> Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/sample_22_1957.png)

> Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","./","d3/","../","d31/"]
>
> Output: 3

**Example 3:**

> Input: logs = ["d1/","../","../","../"]
>
> Output: 0

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= logs.length <= 10^3`
- `2 <= logs[i].length <= 10`
- `logs[i]` contains lowercase English letters, digits, `'.'`, and `'/'`.
- `logs[i]` follows the format described in the statement.
- Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
