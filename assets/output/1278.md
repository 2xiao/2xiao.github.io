# [1278. Palindrome Partitioning III](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-iii)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` containing lowercase letters and an integer `k`.
You need to :

  * First, change some characters of `s` to other lowercase English letters.
  * Then divide `s` into `k` non-empty disjoint substrings such that each substring is a palindrome.

Return _the minimal number of characters that you need to change to divide the
string_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "abc", k = 2
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation:  You can split the string into "ab" and "c", and change 1 character in "ab" to make it palindrome.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "aabbc", k = 3
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation:  You can split the string into "aa", "bb" and "c", all of them are palindrome.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "leetcode", k = 8
> 
> Output: 0

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= s.length <= 100`.
  * `s` only contains lowercase English letters.
