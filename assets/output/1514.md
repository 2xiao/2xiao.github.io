# [1514. Path with Maximum Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/)

## 题目

You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes (0-indexed),
represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [a, b]` is an undirected edge
connecting the nodes `a` and `b` with a probability of success of traversing
that edge `succProb[i]`.

Given two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path with the maximum probability
of success to go from `start` to `end` and return its success probability.

If there is no path from `start` to `end`, **return 0**. Your answer will be
accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most **1e-5**.

**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex1.png)**

> Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2
>
> Output: 0.25000
>
> Explanation: There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.25.

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex2.png)**

> Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2
>
> Output: 0.30000

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex3.png)**

> Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2
>
> Output: 0.00000
>
> Explanation: There is no path between 0 and 2.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= start, end < n`
- `start != end`
- `0 <= a, b < n`
- `a != b`
- `0 <= succProb.length == edges.length <= 2*10^4`
- `0 <= succProb[i] <= 1`
- There is at most one edge between every two nodes.
