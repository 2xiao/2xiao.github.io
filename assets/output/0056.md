# [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

## 题目

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all
overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals
that cover all the intervals in the input_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
>
> Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
>
> Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

**Example 2:**

> Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
>
> Output: [[1,5]]
>
> Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4`
