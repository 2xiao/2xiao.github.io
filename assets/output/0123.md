# [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)

## 题目

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given
stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two
transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e.,
you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

> Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
>
> Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>
> Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

> Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`
