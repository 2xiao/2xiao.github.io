# [2418. Sort the People](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/)

## 题目

You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that
consists of **distinct** positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of
the `ith` person.

Return `names` _sorted in **descending** order by the people's heights_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
>
> Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
>
> Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

**Example 2:**

> Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
>
> Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
>
> Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.

**Constraints:**

- `n == names.length == heights.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^3`
- `1 <= names[i].length <= 20`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5`
- `names[i]` consists of lower and upper case English letters.
- All the values of `heights` are distinct.
