# [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

## 题目

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-
decreasing order** , and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of
elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing
order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be
_stored inside the array_`nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of
`m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be
merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored.
`nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
>
> Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
>
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
>
> The result of the merge is [ _1_ , _2_ ,2, _3_ ,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
>
> Output: [1]
>
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
>
> The result of the merge is [1].

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
>
> Output: [1]
>
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
>
> The result of the merge is [1].
>
> Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

**Constraints:**

- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
