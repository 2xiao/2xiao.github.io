# [2591. Distribute Money to Maximum Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-money-to-maximum-children/)

## 题目

You are given an integer `money` denoting the amount of money (in dollars)
that you have and another integer `children` denoting the number of children
that you must distribute the money to.

You have to distribute the money according to the following rules:

- All money must be distributed.
- Everyone must receive at least `1` dollar.
- Nobody receives `4` dollars.

Return _the **maximum** number of children who may receive **exactly** _`8`
_dollars if you distribute the money according to the aforementioned rules_.
If there is no way to distribute the money, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: money = 20, children = 3
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation:
>
> The maximum number of children with 8 dollars will be 1. One of the ways to distribute the money is:
>
> - 8 dollars to the first child.
> - 9 dollars to the second child.
> - 3 dollars to the third child.
>
> It can be proven that no distribution exists such that number of children getting 8 dollars is greater than 1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: money = 16, children = 2
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: Each child can be given 8 dollars.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= money <= 200`
- `2 <= children <= 30`
