# [2009. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-continuous)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can replace
**any** element in `nums` with **any** integer.

`nums` is considered **continuous** if both of the following conditions are
fulfilled:

  * All elements in `nums` are **unique**.
  * The difference between the **maximum** element and the **minimum** element in `nums` equals `nums.length - 1`.

For example, `nums = [4, 2, 5, 3]` is **continuous** , but `nums = [1, 2, 3,
5, 6]` is **not continuous**.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations to make _`nums`
__**_continuous_**.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation:  nums is already continuous.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,5,6]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation:  One possible solution is to change the last element to 4.
> 
> The resulting array is [1,2,3,5,4], which is continuous.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [1,10,100,1000]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation:  One possible solution is to:
> - Change the second element to 2.
> - Change the third element to 3.
> - Change the fourth element to 4.
> 
> The resulting array is [1,2,3,4], which is continuous.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
