# [297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree)

## 题目

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode
serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360011883654-What-does-1-null-2-3-mean-in-binary-tree-
representation-). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please
be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)

> Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
> 
> Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = []
> 
> Output: []

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
  * `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
