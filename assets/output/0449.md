# [449. Serialize and Deserialize BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-bst/)

## 题目

Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a
network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another
computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a **binary search tree**.
There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm
should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to
a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**The encoded string should be as compact as possible.**

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [2,1,3]
>
> Output: [2,1,3]

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = []
>
> Output: []

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
- The input tree is **guaranteed** to be a binary search tree.
