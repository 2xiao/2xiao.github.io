# [2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store/)

## 题目

You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` specialty retail stores.
There are `m` product types of varying amounts, which are given as a
**0-indexed** integer array `quantities`, where `quantities[i]` represents the
number of products of the `ith` product type.

You need to distribute **all products** to the retail stores following these
rules:

  * A store can only be given **at most one product type** but can be given **any** amount of it.
  * After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly `0`). Let `x` represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want `x` to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to **minimize** the **maximum** number of products that are given to any store.

Return _the minimum possible_ `x`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 6, quantities = [11,6]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: One optimal way is:
> - The 11 products of type 0 are distributed to the first four stores in these amounts: 2, 3, 3, 3
> - The 6 products of type 1 are distributed to the other two stores in these amounts: 3, 3
> 
> The maximum number of products given to any store is max(2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) = 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 7, quantities = [15,10,10]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: One optimal way is:
> - The 15 products of type 0 are distributed to the first three stores in these amounts: 5, 5, 5
> - The 10 products of type 1 are distributed to the next two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
> - The 10 products of type 2 are distributed to the last two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
> 
> The maximum number of products given to any store is max(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5.

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 1, quantities = [100000]
> 
> Output: 100000
> 
> Explanation: The only optimal way is:
> - The 100000 products of type 0 are distributed to the only store.
> 
> The maximum number of products given to any store is max(100000) = 100000.

**Constraints:**

  * `m == quantities.length`
  * `1 <= m <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= quantities[i] <= 105`
