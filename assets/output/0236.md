# [236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree)

## 题目

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes
in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest
common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in
`T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a
descendant of itself** )."



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

    
    
    **Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
    **Output:** 1
    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
  * `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
  * All `Node.val` are **unique**.
  * `p != q`
  * `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.
