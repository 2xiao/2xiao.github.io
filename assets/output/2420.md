# [2420. Find All Good Indices](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-good-indices/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `n` and a positive
integer `k`.

We call an index `i` in the range `k <= i < n - k` **good** if the following
conditions are satisfied:

  * The `k` elements that are just **before** the index `i` are in **non-increasing** order.
  * The `k` elements that are just **after** the index `i` are in **non-decreasing** order.

Return _an array of all good indices sorted in **increasing** order_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,1,1,1,3,4,1], k = 2
> 
> Output: [2,3]
> 
> Explanation: There are two good indices in the array:
> - Index 2. The subarray [2,1] is in non-increasing order, and the subarray [1,3] is in non-decreasing order.
> - Index 3. The subarray [1,1] is in non-increasing order, and the subarray [3,4] is in non-decreasing order.
> 
> Note that the index 4 is not good because [4,1] is not non-decreasing.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,1,1,2], k = 2
> 
> Output: []
> 
> Explanation: There are no good indices in this array.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `3 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
  * `1 <= k <= n / 2`
