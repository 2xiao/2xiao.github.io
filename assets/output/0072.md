# [72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

## 题目

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of
operations required to convert`word1` to `word2`_.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

  * Insert a character
  * Delete a character
  * Replace a character



**Example 1:**

> Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
> 
> rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
> 
> rose -> ros (remove 'e')

**Example 2:**

> Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> intention -> inention (remove 't')
> 
> inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
> 
> enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
> 
> exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
> 
> exection -> execution (insert 'u')

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
  * `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
