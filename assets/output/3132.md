# [3132. Find the Integer Added to Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-integer-added-to-array-ii/)

## 题目

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.

From `nums1` two elements have been removed, and all other elements have been
increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by
the variable `x`.

As a result, `nums1` becomes **equal** to `nums2`. Two arrays are considered
**equal** when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.

Return the **minimum** possible integer **`x` ** that achieves this
equivalence.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [4,20,16,12,8], nums2 = [14,18,10]

**Output:** -2

**Explanation:**

After removing elements at indices `[0,4]` and adding -2, `nums1` becomes
`[18,14,10]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [3,5,5,3], nums2 = [7,7]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

After removing elements at indices `[0,3]` and adding 2, `nums1` becomes
`[7,7]`.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums1.length <= 200`
- `nums2.length == nums1.length - 2`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`
- The test cases are generated in a way that there is an integer `x` such that `nums1` can become equal to `nums2` by removing two elements and adding `x` to each element of `nums1`.
