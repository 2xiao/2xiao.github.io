# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands)

## 题目

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land)
and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent
lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid
are all surrounded by water.



**Example 1:**

> Input: grid = [
> 
>   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
> 
>   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
> 
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
> 
>   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
> 
> ]
> 
> Output: 1

**Example 2:**

> Input: grid = [
> 
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
> 
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
> 
>   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
> 
>   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
> 
> ]
> 
> Output: 3

**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 300`
  * `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
