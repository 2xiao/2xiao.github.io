# [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence)

## 题目

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest
**continuous increasing subsequence** (i.e. subarray)_. The subsequence must
be **strictly** increasing.

A **continuous increasing subsequence** is defined by two indices `l` and `r`
(`l < r`) such that it is `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]`
and for each `l <= i < r`, `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
    Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
    4.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
    increasing.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
