# [2310. Sum of Numbers With Units Digit K](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-numbers-with-units-digit-k)

## 题目

Given two integers `num` and `k`, consider a set of positive integers with the
following properties:

  * The units digit of each integer is `k`.
  * The sum of the integers is `num`.

Return _the **minimum** possible size of such a set, or _`-1` _if no such set
exists._

Note:

  * The set can contain multiple instances of the same integer, and the sum of an empty set is considered `0`.
  * The **units digit** of a number is the rightmost digit of the number.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = 58, k = 9
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:**
    One valid set is [9,49], as the sum is 58 and each integer has a units digit of 9.
    Another valid set is [19,39].
    It can be shown that 2 is the minimum possible size of a valid set.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = 37, k = 2
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** It is not possible to obtain a sum of 37 using only integers that have a units digit of 2.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = 0, k = 7
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** The sum of an empty set is considered 0.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= num <= 3000`
  * `0 <= k <= 9`
