# [2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `players`, where `players[i]`
represents the **ability** of the `ith` player. You are also given a
**0-indexed** integer array `trainers`, where `trainers[j]` represents the
**training capacity** of the `jth` trainer.

The `ith` player can **match** with the `jth` trainer if the player's ability
is **less than or equal to** the trainer's training capacity. Additionally,
the `ith` player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the `jth`
trainer can be matched with at most one player.

Return _the **maximum** number of matchings between _`players` _and_`trainers`
_that satisfy these conditions._

**Example 1:**

> Input: players = [4,7,9], trainers = [8,2,5,8]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation:
>
> One of the ways we can form two matchings is as follows:
>
> - players[0] can be matched with trainers[0] since 4 <= 8.
> - players[1] can be matched with trainers[3] since 7 <= 8.
>
> It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of matchings that can be formed.

**Example 2:**

> Input: players = [1,1,1], trainers = [10]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation:
>
> The trainer can be matched with any of the 3 players.
>
> Each player can only be matched with one trainer, so the maximum answer is 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= players.length, trainers.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= players[i], trainers[j] <= 10^9`
