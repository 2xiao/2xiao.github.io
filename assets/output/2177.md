# [2177. Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-three-consecutive-integers-that-sum-to-a-given-number)

## 题目

Given an integer `num`, return _three consecutive integers (as a sorted
array)_ _that **sum** to _`num`. If `num` cannot be expressed as the sum of
three consecutive integers, return _an **empty** array._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = 33
    **Output:** [10,11,12]
    **Explanation:** 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
    10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = 4
    **Output:** []
    **Explanation:** There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= num <= 1015`
