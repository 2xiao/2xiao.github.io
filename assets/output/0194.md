# [194. Transpose File](https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-file)

## 题目

Given a text file `file.txt`, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns, and each field is
separated by the `' '` character.

**Example:**

If `file.txt` has the following content:

    
    
    name age
    alice 21
    ryan 30
    

Output the following:

    
    
    name alice ryan
    age 21 30
