# [2213. Longest Substring of One Repeating Character](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-of-one-repeating-character/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s`. You are also given a **0-indexed**
string `queryCharacters` of length `k` and a **0-indexed** array of integer
**indices** `queryIndices` of length `k`, both of which are used to describe
`k` queries.

The `ith` query updates the character in `s` at index `queryIndices[i]` to the
character `queryCharacters[i]`.

Return _an array_ `lengths` _of length_`k` _where_ `lengths[i]` _is the
**length** of the **longest substring** of _`s` _consisting of **only one
repeating** character **after** the_ `ith` _query_ _is performed._



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "babacc", queryCharacters = "bcb", queryIndices = [1,3,3]
> 
> Output: [3,3,4]
> 
> Explanation: 
> - 1st query updates s = " _b **b** b_acc". The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is "bbb" with length 3.
> - 2nd query updates s = "bbb _ **c** cc_". 
> 
>   The longest substring consisting of one repeating character can be "bbb" or "ccc" with length 3.
> - 3rd query updates s = " _bbb **b**_ cc". The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is "bbbb" with length 4.
> 
> Thus, we return [3,3,4].

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "abyzz", queryCharacters = "aa", queryIndices = [2,1]
> 
> Output: [2,3]
> 
> Explanation:
> - 1st query updates s = "ab **a** _zz_ ". The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is "zz" with length 2.
> - 2nd query updates s = " _a **a** a_zz". The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is "aaa" with length 3.
> 
> Thus, we return [2,3].

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
  * `k == queryCharacters.length == queryIndices.length`
  * `1 <= k <= 105`
  * `queryCharacters` consists of lowercase English letters.
  * `0 <= queryIndices[i] < s.length`
