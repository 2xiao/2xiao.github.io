# [684. Redundant Connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/)

## 题目

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has
no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1`
to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different**
vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The
graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [ai,
bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return _an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree
of_`n` _nodes_. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs
last in the input.



**Example 1:**

> Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
> 
> Output: [2,3]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-2-graph.jpg)

> Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
> 
> Output: [1,4]

**Constraints:**

  * `n == edges.length`
  * `3 <= n <= 1000`
  * `edges[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length`
  * `ai != bi`
  * There are no repeated edges.
  * The given graph is connected.
