# [2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence)

## 题目

You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English
letters.

Return _the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end
of_`s` _so that_`t` _becomes a **subsequence** of _`s`.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by
deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining
characters.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
> 
> Now, t is a subsequence of s (" _ **co**_ aching _ **ding**_ ").
> 
> It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s (" _ **a**_ bcde").

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
> 
> Now, t is a subsequence of s ("z _ **abcde**_ ").
> 
> It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 105`
  * `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
