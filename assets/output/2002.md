# [2002. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-subsequences)

## 题目

Given a string `s`, find two **disjoint palindromic subsequences** of `s` such
that the **product** of their lengths is **maximized**. The two subsequences
are **disjoint** if they do not both pick a character at the same index.

Return _the **maximum** possible **product** of the lengths of the two
palindromic subsequences_.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by
deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining
characters. A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and
backward.



**Example 1:**

![example-1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/24/two-palindromic-
subsequences.png)

> Input: s = "leetcodecom"
> 
> Output: 9
> 
> **Explanation** : An optimal solution is to choose "ete" for the 1st subsequence and "cdc" for the 2nd subsequence.
> 
> The product of their lengths is: 3 * 3 = 9.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "bb"
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> **Explanation** : An optimal solution is to choose "b" (the first character) for the 1st subsequence and "b" (the second character) for the 2nd subsequence.
> 
> The product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "accbcaxxcxx"
> 
> Output: 25
> 
> **Explanation** : An optimal solution is to choose "accca" for the 1st subsequence and "xxcxx" for the 2nd subsequence.
> 
> The product of their lengths is: 5 * 5 = 25.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= s.length <= 12`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
