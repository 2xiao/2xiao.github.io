# [350. Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii)

## 题目

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _an array of their
intersection_. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it
shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
    **Output:** [2,2]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
    **Output:** [4,9]
    **Explanation:** [9,4] is also accepted.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`



**Follow up:**

  * What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
  * What if `nums1`'s size is small compared to `nums2`'s size? Which algorithm is better?
  * What if elements of `nums2` are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
