# [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits)

## 题目

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Note:**

  * Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
  * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 2** above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
> 
> Output:> 
> 964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
> 
> Explanation: The input binary string **00000010100101000001111010011100** represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is **00111001011110000010100101000000**.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
> 
> Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
> 
> Explanation: The input binary string **11111111111111111111111111111101** represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is **10111111111111111111111111111111**.

**Constraints:**

  * The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`
