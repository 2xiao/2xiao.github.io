# [495. Teemo Attacking](https://leetcode.com/problems/teemo-attacking)

## 题目

Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo
attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly `duration` seconds. More
formally, an attack at second `t` will mean Ashe is poisoned during the
**inclusive** time interval `[t, t + duration - 1]`. If Teemo attacks again
**before** the poison effect ends, the timer for it is **reset** , and the
poison effect will end `duration` seconds after the new attack.

You are given a **non-decreasing** integer array `timeSeries`, where
`timeSeries[i]` denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second `timeSeries[i]`, and
an integer `duration`.

Return _the **total** number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
    - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
    - At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
    Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
    - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
    - At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
    Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= timeSeries.length <= 104`
  * `0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 107`
  * `timeSeries` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
