# [2554. Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-integers-to-choose-from-a-range-i/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `banned` and two integers `n` and `maxSum`. You
are choosing some number of integers following the below rules:

- The chosen integers have to be in the range `[1, n]`.
- Each integer can be chosen **at most once**.
- The chosen integers should not be in the array `banned`.
- The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed `maxSum`.

Return _the **maximum** number of integers you can choose following the
mentioned rules_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: banned = [1,6,5], n = 5, maxSum = 6
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: You can choose the integers 2 and 4.
>
> 2 and 4 are from the range [1, 5], both did not appear in banned, and their sum is 6, which did not exceed maxSum.

**Example 2:**

> Input: banned = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], n = 8, maxSum = 1
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: You cannot choose any integer while following the mentioned conditions.

**Example 3:**

> Input: banned = [11], n = 7, maxSum = 50
>
> Output: 7
>
> Explanation: You can choose the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
>
> They are from the range [1, 7], all did not appear in banned, and their sum is 28, which did not exceed maxSum.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= banned.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= banned[i], n <= 10^4`
- `1 <= maxSum <= 10^9`
