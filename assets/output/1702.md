# [1702. Maximum Binary String After Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-string-after-change)

## 题目

You are given a binary string `binary` consisting of only `0`'s or `1`'s. You
can apply each of the following operations any number of times:

  * Operation 1: If the number contains the substring `"00"`, you can replace it with `"10"`. 
> 
> * For example, `" _00_ 010" -> " _10_ 010`"
  * Operation 2: If the number contains the substring `"10"`, you can replace it with `"01"`. 
> 
> * For example, `"000 _10_ " -> "000 _01_ "`

_Return the **maximum binary string** you can obtain after any number of
operations. Binary string `x` is greater than binary string `y` if `x`'s
decimal representation is greater than `y`'s decimal representation._



**Example 1:**

> Input: binary = "000110"
> 
> Output: "111011"
> 
> Explanation: A valid transformation sequence can be:
> 
> "0001 _10_ " -> "0001 _01_ " 
> 
> " _00_ 0101" -> " _10_ 0101" 
> 
> "1 _00_ 101" -> "1 _10_ 101" 
> 
> "110 _10_ 1" -> "110 _01_ 1" 
> 
> "11 _00_ 11" -> "11 _10_ 11"

**Example 2:**

> Input: binary = "01"
> 
> Output: "01"
> 
> Explanation:  "01" cannot be transformed any further.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= binary.length <= 105`
  * `binary` consist of `'0'` and `'1'`.
