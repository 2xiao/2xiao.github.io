# [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

## 题目

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by
splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
> 
> Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

**Example 2:**

> Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
> 
> Output: []

**Example 3:**

> Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
> 
> Output: [0]

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
  * `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
  * Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
