# [2442. Count Number of Distinct Integers After Reverse Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-distinct-integers-after-reverse-operations/)

## 题目

You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

You have to take each integer in the array, **reverse its digits** , and add
it to the end of the array. You should apply this operation to the original
integers in `nums`.

Return _the number of **distinct** integers in the final array_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,13,10,12,31]
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: After including the reverse of each number, the resulting array is [1,13,10,12,31, _1,31,1,21,13_ ].
>
> The reversed integers that were added to the end of the array are underlined. Note that for the integer 10, after reversing it, it becomes 01 which is just 1.
>
> The number of distinct integers in this array is 6 (The numbers 1, 10, 12, 13, 21, and 31).

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,2,2]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: After including the reverse of each number, the resulting array is [2,2,2, _2,2,2_ ].
>
> The number of distinct integers in this array is 1 (The number 2).

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
