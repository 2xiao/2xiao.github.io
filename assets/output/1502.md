# [1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-make-arithmetic-progression-from-sequence/)

## 题目

A sequence of numbers is called an **arithmetic progression** if the
difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers `arr`, return `true` _if the array can be rearranged
to form an **arithmetic progression**. Otherwise, return_ `false`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: arr = [3,5,1]
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.

**Example 2:**

> Input: arr = [1,2,4]
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
