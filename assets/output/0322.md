# [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different
denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If
that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return
`-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

> Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

**Example 2:**

> Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
>
> Output: -1

**Example 3:**

> Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
>
> Output: 0

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 10^4`
