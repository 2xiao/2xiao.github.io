# [2981. Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-longest-special-substring-that-occurs-thrice-i/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` that consists of lowercase English letters.

A string is called **special** if it is made up of only a single character.
For example, the string `"abc"` is not special, whereas the strings `"ddd"`,
`"zz"`, and `"f"` are special.

Return _the length of the**longest special substring** of _`s` _which
occurs**at least thrice**_ , _or_`-1` _if no special substring occurs at least
thrice_.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a
string.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "aaaa"
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "aa": substrings "_**aa**_ aa", "a _**aa**_ a", and "aa _**aa**_ ".
>
> It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "abcdef"
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: There exists no special substring which occurs at least thrice. Hence return -1.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "abcaba"
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "a": substrings "_**a**_ bcaba", "abc _**a**_ ba", and "abcab _**a**_ ".
>
> It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= s.length <= 50`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
