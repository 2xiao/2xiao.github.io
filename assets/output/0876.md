## 题目

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return _the middle node of the
linked list_.

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.

> Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> Output: [3,4,5]
> 
> Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
> 
> Output: [4,5,6]
> 
> Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
  * `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
