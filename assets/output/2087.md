# [2087. Minimum Cost Homecoming of a Robot in a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-homecoming-of-a-robot-in-a-grid)

## 题目

There is an `m x n` grid, where `(0, 0)` is the top-left cell and `(m - 1, n -
1)` is the bottom-right cell. You are given an integer array `startPos` where
`startPos = [startrow, startcol]` indicates that **initially** , a **robot**
is at the cell `(startrow, startcol)`. You are also given an integer array
`homePos` where `homePos = [homerow, homecol]` indicates that its **home** is
at the cell `(homerow, homecol)`.

The robot needs to go to its home. It can move one cell in four directions:
**left** , **right** , **up** , or **down** , and it can not move outside the
boundary. Every move incurs some cost. You are further given two **0-indexed**
integer arrays: `rowCosts` of length `m` and `colCosts` of length `n`.

  * If the robot moves **up** or **down** into a cell whose **row** is `r`, then this move costs `rowCosts[r]`.
  * If the robot moves **left** or **right** into a cell whose **column** is `c`, then this move costs `colCosts[c]`.

Return _the **minimum total cost** for this robot to return home_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/11/eg-1.png)

> Input: startPos = [1, 0], homePos = [2, 3], rowCosts = [5, 4, 3], colCosts = [8, 2, 6, 7]
> 
> Output: 18
> 
> Explanation: One optimal path is that:
> 
> Starting from (1, 0)
> 
> -> It goes down to ( _ **2**_ , 0). This move costs rowCosts[2] = 3.
> 
> -> It goes right to (2, _**1**_ ). This move costs colCosts[1] = 2.
> 
> -> It goes right to (2, _**2**_ ). This move costs colCosts[2] = 6.
> 
> -> It goes right to (2, _**3**_ ). This move costs colCosts[3] = 7.
> 
> The total cost is 3 + 2 + 6 + 7 = 18

**Example 2:**

> Input: startPos = [0, 0], homePos = [0, 0], rowCosts = [5], colCosts = [26]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: The robot is already at its home. Since no moves occur, the total cost is 0.

**Constraints:**

  * `m == rowCosts.length`
  * `n == colCosts.length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 105`
  * `0 <= rowCosts[r], colCosts[c] <= 104`
  * `startPos.length == 2`
  * `homePos.length == 2`
  * `0 <= startrow, homerow < m`
  * `0 <= startcol, homecol < n`
