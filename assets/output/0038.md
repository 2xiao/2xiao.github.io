# [38. Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

## 题目

The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the
recursive formula:

- `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
- `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say" the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the **minimal**
number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly **one** unique
digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit.
Finally, concatenate every said digit.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322251"`:

Given a positive integer `n`, return _the_`nth` _term of the **count-and-say**
sequence_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 1
>
> Output: "1"
>
> Explanation: This is the base case.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 4
>
> Output: "1211"
>
> Explanation:
>
> countAndSay(1) = "1"
>
> countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
>
> countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
>
> countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 30`
