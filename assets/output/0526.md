# [526. Beautiful Arrangement](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement)

## 题目

Suppose you have `n` integers labeled `1` through `n`. A permutation of those
`n` integers `perm` ( **1-indexed** ) is considered a **beautiful
arrangement** if for every `i` (`1 <= i <= n`), **either** of the following is
true:

  * `perm[i]` is divisible by `i`.
  * `i` is divisible by `perm[i]`.

Given an integer `n`, return _the **number** of the **beautiful arrangements**
that you can construct_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 2
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** 
    The first beautiful arrangement is [1,2]:
        - perm[1] = 1 is divisible by i = 1
        - perm[2] = 2 is divisible by i = 2
    The second beautiful arrangement is [2,1]:
        - perm[1] = 2 is divisible by i = 1
        - i = 2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 1
    **Output:** 1
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 15`
