# [2406. Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-intervals-into-minimum-number-of-groups/)

## 题目

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [lefti,
righti]` represents the **inclusive** interval `[lefti, righti]`.

You have to divide the intervals into one or more **groups** such that each
interval is in **exactly** one group, and no two intervals that are in the
same group **intersect** each other.

Return _the **minimum** number of groups you need to make_.

Two intervals **intersect** if there is at least one common number between
them. For example, the intervals `[1, 5]` and `[5, 8]` intersect.

**Example 1:**

> Input: intervals = [[5,10],[6,8],[1,5],[2,3],[1,10]]
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: We can divide the intervals into the following groups:
>
> - Group 1: [1, 5], [6, 8].
> - Group 2: [2, 3], [5, 10].
> - Group 3: [1, 10].
>
> It can be proven that it is not possible to divide the intervals into fewer than 3 groups.

**Example 2:**

> Input: intervals = [[1,3],[5,6],[8,10],[11,13]]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: None of the intervals overlap, so we can put all of them in one group.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 10^6`
