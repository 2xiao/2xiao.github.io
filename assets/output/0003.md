# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

## 题目

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without
repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "abcabcbb"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "bbbbb"
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "pwwkew"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
>
> Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
