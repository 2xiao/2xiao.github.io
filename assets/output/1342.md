# [1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/)

## 题目

Given an integer `num`, return _the number of steps to reduce it to zero_.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`,
otherwise, you have to subtract `1` from it.



**Example 1:**

> Input: num = 14
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation:  
> 
> Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
> 
> Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
> 
> Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
> 
> Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
> 
> Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
> 
> Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

**Example 2:**

> Input: num = 8
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation:  
> 
> Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
> 
> Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
> 
> Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
> 
> Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

**Example 3:**

> Input: num = 123
> 
> Output: 12

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= num <= 106`
