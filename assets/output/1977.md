# [1977. Number of Ways to Separate Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-separate-numbers/)

## 题目

You wrote down many **positive** integers in a string called `num`. However,
you realized that you forgot to add commas to seperate the different numbers.
You remember that the list of integers was **non-decreasing** and that **no**
integer had leading zeros.

Return _the **number of possible lists of integers** that you could have
written down to get the string _`num`. Since the answer may be large, return
it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: num = "327"
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: You could have written down the numbers:
>
> 3, 27
>
> 327

**Example 2:**

> Input: num = "094"
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: No numbers can have leading zeros and all numbers must be positive.

**Example 3:**

> Input: num = "0"
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: No numbers can have leading zeros and all numbers must be positive.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num.length <= 3500`
- `num` consists of digits `'0'` through `'9'`.
