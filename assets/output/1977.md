# [1977. Number of Ways to Separate Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-separate-numbers)

## 题目

You wrote down many **positive** integers in a string called `num`. However,
you realized that you forgot to add commas to seperate the different numbers.
You remember that the list of integers was **non-decreasing** and that **no**
integer had leading zeros.

Return _the **number of possible lists of integers** that you could have
written down to get the string _`num`. Since the answer may be large, return
it **modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = "327"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** You could have written down the numbers:
    3, 27
    327
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = "094"
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** No numbers can have leading zeros and all numbers must be positive.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** num = "0"
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** No numbers can have leading zeros and all numbers must be positive.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= num.length <= 3500`
  * `num` consists of digits `'0'` through `'9'`.
