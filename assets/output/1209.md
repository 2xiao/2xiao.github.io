# [1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`, a `k` **duplicate removal**
consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing
them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to
concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return _the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made_. It
is guaranteed that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
>
> Output: "abcd"
>
> Explanation: There's nothing to delete.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
>
> Output: "aa"
>
> Explanation: First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
>
> Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
>
> Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
>
> Output: "ps"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `2 <= k <= 10^4`
- `s` only contains lowercase English letters.
