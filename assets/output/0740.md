# [740. Delete and Earn](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of
points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and **every** element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.

Return _the **maximum number of points** you can earn by applying the above
operation some number of times_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [3,4,2]
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
>
> - Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
> - Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
>
> You earn a total of 6 points.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
>
> Output: 9
>
> Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
>
> - Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
> - Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
> - Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
>
> You earn a total of 9 points.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
