# [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring)

## 题目

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the
**minimum window**_ **_substring_** _of_`s` _such that every character in_`t`
_( **including duplicates** ) is included in the window_. If there is no such
substring, return _the empty string_`""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
    **Output:** "BANC"
    **Explanation:** The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "a", t = "a"
    **Output:** "a"
    **Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "a", t = "aa"
    **Output:** ""
    **Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
    Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == s.length`
  * `n == t.length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 105`
  * `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.



**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
