## 题目

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]`.
Every event `i` starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`.

You can attend an event `i` at any day `d` where `startTimei <= d <=
endTimei`. You can only attend one event at any time `d`.

Return _the maximum number of events you can attend_.
