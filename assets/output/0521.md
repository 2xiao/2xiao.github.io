# [521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-i/)

## 题目

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return _the length of the **longest uncommon
subsequence** between _`a` _and_ `b`. If the longest uncommon subsequence does
not exist, return `-1`.

An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a
**subsequence of one but not the other**.

A **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be obtained after
deleting any number of characters from `s`.

- For example, `"abc"` is a subsequence of `"aebdc"` because you can delete the underlined characters in `"a _e_ b _d_ c"` to get `"abc"`. Other subsequences of `"aebdc"` include `"aebdc"`, `"aeb"`, and `""` (empty string).

**Example 1:**

> Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
>
> Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.

**Example 2:**

> Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".

**Example 3:**

> Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100`
- `a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.
