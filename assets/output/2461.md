# [2461. Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-distinct-subarrays-with-length-k)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum
subarray sum of all the subarrays of `nums` that meet the following
conditions:

  * The length of the subarray is `k`, and
  * All the elements of the subarray are **distinct**.

Return _the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the
conditions_ _._ If no subarray meets the conditions, return `0`.

_A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an
array._



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
> 
> Output: 15
> 
> Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
> - [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
> - [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
> - [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
> - [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
> - [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
> 
> We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
> - [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
> 
> We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
