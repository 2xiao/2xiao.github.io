# [224. Basic Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator)

## 题目

Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic
calculator to evaluate it, and return _the result of the evaluation_.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates
strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "1 + 1"
> 
> Output: 2

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
> 
> Output: 3

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
> 
> Output: 23

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
  * `s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.
  * `s` represents a valid expression.
  * `'+'` is **not** used as a unary operation (i.e., `"+1"` and `"+(2 + 3)"` is invalid).
  * `'-'` could be used as a unary operation (i.e., `"-1"` and `"-(2 + 3)"` is valid).
  * There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
  * Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
