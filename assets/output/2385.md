# [2385. Amount of Time for Binary Tree to Be Infected](https://leetcode.com/problems/amount-of-time-for-binary-tree-to-be-infected/)

## 题目

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with **unique** values, and an
integer `start`. At minute `0`, an **infection** starts from the node with
value `start`.

Each minute, a node becomes infected if:

- The node is currently uninfected.
- The node is adjacent to an infected node.

Return _the number of minutes needed for the entire tree to be infected._

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [1,5,3,null,4,10,6,9,2], start = 3
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation: The following nodes are infected during:
>
> - Minute 0: Node 3
> - Minute 1: Nodes 1, 10 and 6
> - Minute 2: Node 5
> - Minute 3: Node 4
> - Minute 4: Nodes 9 and 2
>
> It takes 4 minutes for the whole tree to be infected so we return 4.

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [1], start = 1
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: At minute 0, the only node in the tree is infected so we return 0.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- Each node has a **unique** value.
- A node with a value of `start` exists in the tree.
