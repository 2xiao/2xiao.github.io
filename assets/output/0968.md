# [968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/)

## 题目

You are given the `root` of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree
nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its
immediate children.

Return _the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the
tree_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `Node.val == 0`
