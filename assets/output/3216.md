# [3216. Lexicographically Smallest String After a Swap](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-string-after-a-swap/)

## 题目

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the lexicographically
smallest string that can be obtained after swapping **adjacent** digits in `s`
with the same **parity** at most **once**.

Digits have the same parity if both are odd or both are even. For example, 5
and 9, as well as 2 and 4, have the same parity, while 6 and 9 do not.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "45320"

**Output:** "43520"

**Explanation:**

`s[1] == '5'` and `s[2] == '3'` both have the same parity, and swapping them
results in the lexicographically smallest string.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "001"

**Output:** "001"

**Explanation:**

There is no need to perform a swap because `s` is already the
lexicographically smallest.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of digits.
