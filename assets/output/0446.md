# [446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices-ii-subsequence)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of all the **arithmetic
subsequences** of_ `nums`.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three
elements** and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the
same.

  * For example, `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `[7, 7, 7, 7]`, and `[3, -1, -5, -9]` are arithmetic sequences.
  * For example, `[1, 1, 2, 5, 7]` is not an arithmetic sequence.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing
some elements (possibly none) of the array.

  * For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1, ** _2_** ,4,1, _ **5**_ , _ **10**_ ]`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in **32-bit** integer.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
> 
> Output: 7
> 
> Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
> 
> [2,4,6]
> 
> [4,6,8]
> 
> [6,8,10]
> 
> [2,4,6,8]
> 
> [4,6,8,10]
> 
> [2,4,6,8,10]
> 
> [2,6,10]

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7]
> 
> Output: 16
> 
> Explanation: Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.

**Constraints:**

  * `1  <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
