# [2048. Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-numerically-balanced-number)

## 题目

An integer `x` is **numerically balanced** if for every digit `d` in the
number `x`, there are **exactly** `d` occurrences of that digit in `x`.

Given an integer `n`, return _the **smallest numerically balanced** number
**strictly greater** than _`n` _._



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 1
> 
> Output: 22
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> 22 is numerically balanced since:
> - The digit 2 occurs 2 times. 
> 
> It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 1000
> 
> Output: 1333
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> 1333 is numerically balanced since:
> - The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
> - The digit 3 occurs 3 times. 
> 
> It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1000.
> 
> Note that 1022 cannot be the answer because 0 appeared more than 0 times.

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 3000
> 
> Output: 3133
> 
> Explanation: 
> 
> 3133 is numerically balanced since:
> - The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
> - The digit 3 occurs 3 times.
> 
> It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 3000.

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= n <= 106`
