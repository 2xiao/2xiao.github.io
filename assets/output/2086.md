# [2086. Minimum Number of Food Buckets to Feed the Hamsters](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-food-buckets-to-feed-the-hamsters/)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** string `hamsters` where `hamsters[i]` is either:

- `'H'` indicating that there is a hamster at index `i`, or
- `'.'` indicating that index `i` is empty.

You will add some number of food buckets at the empty indices in order to feed
the hamsters. A hamster can be fed if there is at least one food bucket to its
left or to its right. More formally, a hamster at index `i` can be fed if you
place a food bucket at index `i - 1` **and/or** at index `i + 1`.

Return _the minimum number of food buckets you should **place at empty
indices** to feed all the hamsters or _`-1` _if it is impossible to feed all
of them_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: hamsters = "H..H"
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: We place two food buckets at indices 1 and 2.
>
> It can be shown that if we place only one food bucket, one of the hamsters will not be fed.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/11/01/example2.png)

> Input: hamsters = ".H.H."
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: We place one food bucket at index 2.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/11/01/example3.png)

> Input: hamsters = ".HHH."
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: If we place a food bucket at every empty index as shown, the hamster at index 2 will not be able to eat.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= hamsters.length <= 10^5`
- `hamsters[i]` is either`'H'` or `'.'`.
