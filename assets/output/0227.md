# [227. Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/)

## 题目

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, _evaluate this expression
and return its value_.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate
results will be in the range of `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates
strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "3+2\*2"
>
> Output: 7

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = " 3/2 "
>
> Output: 1

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
>
> Output: 5

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5`
- `s` consists of integers and operators `('+', '-', '*', '/')` separated by some number of spaces.
- `s` represents **a valid expression**.
- All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range `[0, 2^31 - 1]`.
- The answer is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit integer**.
