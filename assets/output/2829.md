# [2829. Determine the Minimum Sum of a k-avoiding Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-the-minimum-sum-of-a-k-avoiding-array/)

## 题目

You are given two integers, `n` and `k`.

An array of **distinct** positive integers is called a **k-avoiding** array if
there does not exist any pair of distinct elements that sum to `k`.

Return _the **minimum** possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length _`n`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 5, k = 4
> 
> Output: 18
> 
> Explanation: Consider the k-avoiding array [1,2,4,5,6], which has a sum of 18.
> 
> It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 18.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 2, k = 6
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: We can construct the array [1,2], which has a sum of 3.
> 
> It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 3.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n, k <= 50`
