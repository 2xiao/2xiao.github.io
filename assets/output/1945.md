# [1945. Sum of Digits of String After Convert](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-of-string-after-convert/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, and an
integer `k`.

First, **convert** `s` into an integer by replacing each letter with its
position in the alphabet (i.e., replace `'a'` with `1`, `'b'` with `2`, ...,
`'z'` with `26`). Then, **transform** the integer by replacing it with the
**sum of its digits**. Repeat the **transform** operation `k` **times** in
total.

For example, if `s = "zbax"` and `k = 2`, then the resulting integer would be
`8` by the following operations:

  * **Convert** : `"zbax" ➝ "(26)(2)(1)(24)" ➝ "262124" ➝ 262124`
  * **Transform #1** : `262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17`
  * **Transform #2** : `17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8`

Return _the resulting integer after performing the operations described
above_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "iiii", k = 1
> 
> Output: 36
> 
> Explanation: The operations are as follows:
> - Convert: "iiii" ➝ "(9)(9)(9)(9)" ➝ "9999" ➝ 9999
> - Transform #1: 9999 ➝ 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 ➝ 36
> 
> Thus the resulting integer is 36.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "leetcode", k = 2
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: The operations are as follows:
> - Convert: "leetcode" ➝ "(12)(5)(5)(20)(3)(15)(4)(5)" ➝ "12552031545" ➝ 12552031545
> - Transform #1: 12552031545 ➝ 1 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 ➝ 33
> - Transform #2: 33 ➝ 3 + 3 ➝ 6
> 
> Thus the resulting integer is 6.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "zbax", k = 2
> 
> Output: 8

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= k <= 10`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
