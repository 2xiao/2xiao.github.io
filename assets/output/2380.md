# [2380. Time Needed to Rearrange a Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-rearrange-a-binary-string/)

## 题目

You are given a binary string `s`. In one second, **all** occurrences of
`"01"` are **simultaneously** replaced with `"10"`. This process **repeats**
until no occurrences of `"01"` exist.

Return _the number of seconds needed to complete this process._

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "0110101"
>
> Output: 4
>
> Explanation:
>
> After one second, s becomes "1011010".
>
> After another second, s becomes "1101100".
>
> After the third second, s becomes "1110100".
>
> After the fourth second, s becomes "1111000".
>
> No occurrence of "01" exists any longer, and the process needed 4 seconds to complete,
>
> so we return 4.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "11100"
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation:
>
> No occurrence of "01" exists in s, and the processes needed 0 seconds to complete,
>
> so we return 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

**Follow up:**

Can you solve this problem in O(n) time complexity?
