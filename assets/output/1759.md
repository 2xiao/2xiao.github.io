# [1759. Count Number of Homogenous Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-homogenous-substrings)

## 题目

Given a string `s`, return _the number of **homogenous** substrings of _`s`
_._ Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A string is **homogenous** if all the characters of the string are the same.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "abbcccaa"
> 
> Output: 13
> 
> Explanation: The homogenous substrings are listed as below:
> 
> "a"   appears 3 times.
> 
> "aa"  appears 1 time.
> 
> "b"   appears 2 times.
> 
> "bb"  appears 1 time.
> 
> "c"   appears 3 times.
> 
> "cc"  appears 2 times.
> 
> "ccc" appears 1 time.
> 
> 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "xy"
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: The homogenous substrings are "x" and "y".

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "zzzzz"
> 
> Output: 15

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of lowercase letters.
