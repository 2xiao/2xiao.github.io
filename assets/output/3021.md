# [3021. Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/alice-and-bob-playing-flower-game/)

## 题目

Alice and Bob are playing a turn-based game on a circular field surrounded by
flowers. The circle represents the field, and there are `x` flowers in the
clockwise direction between Alice and Bob, and `y` flowers in the anti-
clockwise direction between them.

The game proceeds as follows:

1. Alice takes the first turn.
2. In each turn, a player must choose either the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and pick one flower from that side.
3. At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all, the **current** player captures their opponent and wins the game.

Given two integers, `n` and `m`, the task is to compute the number of possible
pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the conditions:

- Alice must win the game according to the described rules.
- The number of flowers `x` in the clockwise direction must be in the range `[1,n]`.
- The number of flowers `y` in the anti-clockwise direction must be in the range `[1,m]`.

Return _the number of possible pairs_ `(x, y)` _that satisfy the conditions
mentioned in the statement_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 3, m = 2
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The following pairs satisfy conditions described in the statement: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1).

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 1, m = 1
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: No pairs satisfy the conditions described in the statement.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n, m <= 10^5`
