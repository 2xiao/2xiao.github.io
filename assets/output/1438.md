# [1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit)

## 题目

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of
the longest **non-empty** subarray such that the absolute difference between
any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit` _._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
    **Output:** 2 
    **Explanation:** All subarrays are: 
    [8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
    [8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
    [8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
    [8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
    [2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
    [2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
    [2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
    [4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
    [4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
    [7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
    Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
    **Output:** 4 
    **Explanation:** The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
    **Output:** 3
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `0 <= limit <= 109`
