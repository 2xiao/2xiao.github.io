# [2271. Maximum White Tiles Covered by a Carpet](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-white-tiles-covered-by-a-carpet/)

## 题目

You are given a 2D integer array `tiles` where `tiles[i] = [li, ri]`
represents that every tile `j` in the range `li <= j <= ri` is colored white.

You are also given an integer `carpetLen`, the length of a single carpet that
can be placed **anywhere**.

Return _the **maximum** number of white tiles that can be covered by the
carpet_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: tiles = [[1,5],[10,11],[12,18],[20,25],[30,32]], carpetLen = 10
>
> Output: 9
>
> Explanation: Place the carpet starting on tile 10.
>
> It covers 9 white tiles, so we return 9.
>
> Note that there may be other places where the carpet covers 9 white tiles.
>
> It can be shown that the carpet cannot cover more than 9 white tiles.

**Example 2:**

> Input: tiles = [[10,11],[1,1]], carpetLen = 2
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: Place the carpet starting on tile 10.
>
> It covers 2 white tiles, so we return 2.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tiles.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `tiles[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= li <= ri <= 10^9`
- `1 <= carpetLen <= 10^9`
- The `tiles` are **non-overlapping**.
