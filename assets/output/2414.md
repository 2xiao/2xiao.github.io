# [2414. Length of the Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-the-longest-alphabetical-continuous-substring)

## 题目

An **alphabetical continuous string** is a string consisting of consecutive
letters in the alphabet. In other words, it is any substring of the string
`"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`.

  * For example, `"abc"` is an alphabetical continuous string, while `"acb"` and `"za"` are not.

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters only, return the _length of
the **longest** alphabetical continuous substring._



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "abacaba"
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: There are 4 distinct continuous substrings: "a", "b", "c" and "ab".
> 
> "ab" is the longest continuous substring.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "abcde"
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: "abcde" is the longest continuous substring.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of only English lowercase letters.
