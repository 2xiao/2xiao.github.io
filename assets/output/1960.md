# [1960. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-substrings)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and are tasked with finding two
**non-intersecting palindromic** substrings of **odd** length such that the
product of their lengths is maximized.

More formally, you want to choose four integers `i`, `j`, `k`, `l` such that
`0 <= i <= j < k <= l < s.length` and both the substrings `s[i...j]` and
`s[k...l]` are palindromes and have odd lengths. `s[i...j]` denotes a
substring from index `i` to index `j` **inclusive**.

Return _the **maximum** possible product of the lengths of the two non-
intersecting palindromic substrings._

A **palindrome** is a string that is the same forward and backward. A
**substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "ababbb"
> 
> Output: 9
> 
> Explanation: Substrings "aba" and "bbb" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 * 3 = 9.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "zaaaxbbby"
> 
> Output: 9
> 
> Explanation: Substrings "aaa" and "bbb" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 * 3 = 9.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
