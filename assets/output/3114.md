# [3114. Latest Time You Can Obtain After Replacing Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/latest-time-you-can-obtain-after-replacing-characters/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` representing a 12-hour format time where some of
the digits (possibly none) are replaced with a `"?"`.

12-hour times are formatted as `"HH:MM"`, where `HH` is between `00` and `11`,
and `MM` is between `00` and `59`. The earliest 12-hour time is `00:00`, and
the latest is `11:59`.

You have to replace **all** the `"?"` characters in `s` with digits such that
the time we obtain by the resulting string is a **valid** 12-hour format time
and is the **latest** possible.

Return _the resulting string_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "1?:?4"

**Output:** "11:54"

**Explanation:** The latest 12-hour format time we can achieve by replacing
`"?"` characters is `"11:54"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "0?:5?"

**Output:** "09:59"

**Explanation:** The latest 12-hour format time we can achieve by replacing
`"?"` characters is `"09:59"`.

**Constraints:**

- `s.length == 5`
- `s[2]` is equal to the character `":"`.
- All characters except `s[2]` are digits or `"?"` characters.
- The input is generated such that there is **at least** one time between `"00:00"` and `"11:59"` that you can obtain after replacing the `"?"` characters.
