# [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

## 题目

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0`
to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where
`prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi`
first if you want to take course `ai`.

  * For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
> 
> To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

**Example 2:**

> Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
> 
> To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
  * `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
  * `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
  * All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.
