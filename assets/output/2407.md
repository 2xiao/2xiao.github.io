# [2407. Longest Increasing Subsequence II](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence-ii)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Find the longest subsequence of `nums` that meets the following requirements:

  * The subsequence is **strictly increasing** and
  * The difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is **at most** `k`.

Return _the length of the **longest** **subsequence** that meets the
requirements._

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [4,2,1,4,3,4,5,8,15], k = 3
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [1,3,4,5,8].
> 
> The subsequence has a length of 5, so we return 5.
> 
> Note that the subsequence [1,3,4,5,8,15] does not meet the requirements because 15 - 8 = 7 is larger than 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [7,4,5,1,8,12,4,7], k = 5
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [4,5,8,12].
> 
> The subsequence has a length of 4, so we return 4.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [1,5], k = 1
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [1].
> 
> The subsequence has a length of 1, so we return 1.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i], k <= 105`
