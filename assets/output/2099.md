# [2099. Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-subsequence-of-length-k-with-the-largest-sum/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find a
**subsequence** of `nums` of length `k` that has the **largest** sum.

Return _\_\_**any** such subsequence as an integer array of length _`k`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
>
> Output: [3,3]
>
> Explanation:
>
> The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3
>
> Output: [-1,3,4]
>
> Explanation:
>
> The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2
>
> Output: [3,4]
>
> Explanation:
>
> The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7.
>
> Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
