# [547. Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/)

## 题目

There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city
`a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly
with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no
other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if
the `ith` city and the `jth` city are directly connected, and
`isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return _the total number of **provinces**_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
>
> Output: 2

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/graph2.jpg)

> Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
>
> Output: 3

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `n == isConnected.length`
- `n == isConnected[i].length`
- `isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.
- `isConnected[i][i] == 1`
- `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`
