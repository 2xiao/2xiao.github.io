# [1408. String Matching in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-matching-in-an-array)

## 题目

Given an array of string `words`, return _all strings in_`words` _that is a
**substring** of another word_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string



**Example 1:**

> Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
> 
> Output: ["as","hero"]
> 
> Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
> 
> ["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

> Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
> 
> Output: ["et","code"]
> 
> Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".

**Example 3:**

> Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
> 
> Output: []
> 
> Explanation: No string of words is substring of another string.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
  * `words[i]` contains only lowercase English letters.
  * All the strings of `words` are **unique**.
