# [518. Coin Change II](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different
denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the number of combinations that make up that amount_. If that amount
of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.



**Example 1:**

> Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
> 
> 5=5
> 
> 5=2+2+1
> 
> 5=2+1+1+1
> 
> 5=1+1+1+1+1

**Example 2:**

> Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

**Example 3:**

> Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
> 
> Output: 1

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= coins.length <= 300`
  * `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`
  * All the values of `coins` are **unique**.
  * `0 <= amount <= 5000`
