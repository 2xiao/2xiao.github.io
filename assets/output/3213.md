# [3213. Construct String with Minimum Cost](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-with-minimum-cost/)

## 题目

You are given a string `target`, an array of strings `words`, and an integer
array `costs`, both arrays of the same length.

Imagine an empty string `s`.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including
**zero**):

- Choose an index `i` in the range `[0, words.length - 1]`.
- Append `words[i]` to `s`.
- The cost of operation is `costs[i]`.

Return the **minimum** cost to make `s` equal to `target`. If it's not
possible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** target = "abcdef", words = ["abdef","abc","d","def","ef"], costs =
[100,1,1,10,5]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

The minimum cost can be achieved by performing the following operations:

- Select index 1 and append `"abc"` to `s` at a cost of 1, resulting in `s = "abc"`.
- Select index 2 and append `"d"` to `s` at a cost of 1, resulting in `s = "abcd"`.
- Select index 4 and append `"ef"` to `s` at a cost of 5, resulting in `s = "abcdef"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** target = "aaaa", words = ["z","zz","zzz"], costs = [1,10,100]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

It is impossible to make `s` equal to `target`, so we return -1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= target.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= words.length == costs.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= target.length`
- The total sum of `words[i].length` is less than or equal to `5 * 10^4`.
- `target` and `words[i]` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= costs[i] <= 10^4`
