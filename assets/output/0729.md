# [729. My Calendar I](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i)

## 题目

You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event
if adding the event will not cause a **double booking**.

A **double booking** happens when two events have some non-empty intersection
(i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers `start` and `end` that
represents a booking on the half-open interval `[start, end)`, the range of
real numbers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.

Implement the `MyCalendar` class:

  * `MyCalendar()` Initializes the calendar object.
  * `boolean book(int start, int end)` Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a **double booking**. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.



**Example 1:**

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **Input**
> 
> ["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
> 
> [[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
> 
> **Output**
> 
> [null, true, false, true]
> 
> 
> 
> **Explanation**
> 
> MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
> 
> myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
> 
> myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.
> 
> myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= start < end <= 109`
  * At most `1000` calls will be made to `book`.
