# [844. Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)

## 题目

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if they are equal when both are
typed into empty text editors_. `'#'` means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: Both s and t become "".

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200`
  * `s` and `t` only contain lowercase letters and `'#'` characters.



**Follow up:** Can you solve it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?
