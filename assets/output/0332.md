# [332. Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/)

## 题目

You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]`
represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct
the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the
itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries,
you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read
as a single string.

- For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all
the tickets once and only once.

**Example 1:**

> Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
>
> Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]

**Example 2:**

> Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
>
> Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
>
> Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
- `tickets[i].length == 2`
- `fromi.length == 3`
- `toi.length == 3`
- `fromi` and `toi` consist of uppercase English letters.
- `fromi != toi`
