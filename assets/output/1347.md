# [1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/)

## 题目

You are given two strings of the same length `s` and `t`. In one step you can
choose **any character** of `t` and replace it with **another character**.

Return _the minimum number of steps_ to make `t` an anagram of `s`.

An **Anagram** of a string is a string that contains the same characters with
a different (or the same) ordering.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s.length == t.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.
