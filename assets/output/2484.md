# [2484. Count Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-palindromic-subsequences)

## 题目

Given a string of digits `s`, return _the number of **palindromic
subsequences** of_ `s` _having length_`5`. Since the answer may be very large,
return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Note:**

  * A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.
  * A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "103301"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** 
    There are 6 possible subsequences of length 5: "10330","10331","10301","10301","13301","03301". 
    Two of them (both equal to "10301") are palindromic.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "0000000"
    **Output:** 21
    **Explanation:** All 21 subsequences are "00000", which is palindromic.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "9999900000"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** The only two palindromic subsequences are "99999" and "00000".
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s` consists of digits.
