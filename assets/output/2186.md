# [2186. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram-ii/)

## 题目

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. In one step, you can append **any
character** to either `s` or `t`.

Return _the minimum number of steps to make_`s` _and_`t` _**anagrams** of each
other._

An **anagram** of a string is a string that contains the same characters with
a different (or the same) ordering.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = " ** _lee_** tco _ **de**_ ", t = "co _ **a**_ t _ **s**_ "
>
> Output: 7
>
> Explanation:
>
> - In 2 steps, we can append the letters in "as" onto s = "leetcode", forming s = "leetcode ** _as_** ".
> - In 5 steps, we can append the letters in "leede" onto t = "coats", forming t = "coats _ **leede**_ ".
>
> "leetcodeas" and "coatsleede" are now anagrams of each other.
>
> We used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.
>
> It can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "night", t = "thing"
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: The given strings are already anagrams of each other. Thus, we do not need any further steps.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
