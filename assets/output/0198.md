# [198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber)

## 题目

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you
from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems
connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent
houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house,
return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the
police**_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
> 
> Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
> 
> Output: 12
> 
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
> 
> Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`
