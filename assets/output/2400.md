# [2400. Number of Ways to Reach a Position After Exactly k Steps](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reach-a-position-after-exactly-k-steps/)

## 题目

You are given two **positive** integers `startPos` and `endPos`. Initially,
you are standing at position `startPos` on an **infinite** number line. With
one step, you can move either one position to the left, or one position to the
right.

Given a positive integer `k`, return _the number of **different** ways to
reach the position _`endPos` _starting from_`startPos` _, such that you
perform **exactly** _`k` _steps_. Since the answer may be very large, return
it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

Two ways are considered different if the order of the steps made is not
exactly the same.

**Note** that the number line includes negative integers.

**Example 1:**

> Input: startPos = 1, endPos = 2, k = 3
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: We can reach position 2 from 1 in exactly 3 steps in three ways:
>
> - 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2.
> - 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2.
> - 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2.
>
> It can be proven that no other way is possible, so we return 3.

**Example 2:**

> Input: startPos = 2, endPos = 5, k = 10
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: It is impossible to reach position 5 from position 2 in exactly 10 steps.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= startPos, endPos, k <= 1000`
