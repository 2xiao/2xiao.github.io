# [2594. Minimum Time to Repair Cars](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-repair-cars/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `ranks` representing the **ranks** of some
mechanics. ranksi is the rank of the ith mechanic. A mechanic with a rank `r`
can repair n cars in `r * n2` minutes.

You are also given an integer `cars` representing the total number of cars
waiting in the garage to be repaired.

Return _the **minimum** time taken to repair all the cars._

**Note:** All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.

**Example 1:**

> Input: ranks = [4,2,3,1], cars = 10
>
> Output: 16
>
> Explanation:
>
> - The first mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 4 _ 2 _ 2 = 16 minutes.
> - The second mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 2 _ 2 _ 2 = 8 minutes.
> - The third mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 3 _ 2 _ 2 = 12 minutes.
> - The fourth mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 _ 4 _ 4 = 16 minutes.
>
> It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.​​​​​

**Example 2:**

> Input: ranks = [5,1,8], cars = 6
>
> Output: 16
>
> Explanation:
>
> - The first mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 5 _ 1 _ 1 = 5 minutes.
> - The second mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 _ 4 _ 4 = 16 minutes.
> - The third mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 8 _ 1 _ 1 = 8 minutes.
>
> It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.​​​​​

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= ranks.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= ranks[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= cars <= 10^6`
