# [1941. Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-characters-have-equal-number-of-occurrences)

## 题目

Given a string `s`, return `true` _if_`s` _is a **good** string, or _`false`
_otherwise_.

A string `s` is **good** if **all** the characters that appear in `s` have the
**same** number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "abacbc"
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "aaabb"
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
> 
> 'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
