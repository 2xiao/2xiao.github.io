# [771. Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones)

## 题目

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are
jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in
`stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones
you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone
from `"A"`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
> 
> Output: 3

**Example 2:**

> Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
> 
> Output: 0

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50`
  * `jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.
  * All the characters of `jewels` are **unique**.
