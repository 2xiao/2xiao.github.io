# [3039. Apply Operations to Make String Empty](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-make-string-empty/)

## 题目

You are given a string `s`.

Consider performing the following operation until `s` becomes **empty** :

- For **every** alphabet character from `'a'` to `'z'`, remove the **first** occurrence of that character in `s` (if it exists).

For example, let initially `s = "aabcbbca"`. We do the following operations:

- Remove the underlined characters `s = "_**a**_ a** _bc_** bbca"`. The resulting string is `s = "abbca"`.
- Remove the underlined characters `s = "_**ab**_ b _**c**_ a"`. The resulting string is `s = "ba"`.
- Remove the underlined characters `s = "_**ba**_ "`. The resulting string is `s = ""`.

Return _the value of the string_`s` _right**before** applying the **last**
operation_. In the example above, answer is `"ba"`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "aabcbbca"
>
> Output: "ba"
>
> Explanation: Explained in the statement.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "abcd"
>
> Output: "abcd"
>
> Explanation: We do the following operation:
>
> - Remove the underlined characters s = "_**abcd**_ ". The resulting string is s = "".
>
> The string just before the last operation is "abcd".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
