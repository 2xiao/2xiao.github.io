# [1599. Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-of-operating-a-centennial-wheel/)

## 题目

You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has **four gondolas** , and
each gondola has room for **up** **to** **four people**. You have the ability
to rotate the gondolas **counterclockwise** , which costs you `runningCost`
dollars.

You are given an array `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is the
number of new customers arriving just before the `ith` rotation (0-indexed).
This means you **must rotate the wheel**`i` **times before the**`customers[i]`
**customers arrive**. **You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the
gondola**. Each customer pays `boardingCost` dollars when they board on the
gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the
ground again.

You can stop the wheel at any time, including **before** **serving** **all**
**customers**. If you decide to stop serving customers, **all subsequent
rotations are free** in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that
if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only
four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait **for the next rotation**.

Return _the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your
profit._ If there is **no scenario** where the profit is positive, return
`-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/wheeldiagram12.png)

> Input: customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.
>
> 1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 _ $5 - 1 _ $6 = $14.
>
> 2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 _ $5 - 2 _ $6 = $28.
>
> 3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 _ $5 - 3 _ $6 = $37.
>
> The highest profit was $37 after rotating the wheel 3 times.

**Example 2:**

> Input: customers = [10,9,6], boardingCost = 6, runningCost = 4
>
> Output: 7
>
> Explanation:
>
> 1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 _ $6 - 1 _ $4 = $20.
>
> 2. 9 customers arrive, 4 board and 11 wait (2 originally waiting, 9 newly waiting), the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 _ $6 - 2 _ $4 = $40.
>
> 3. The final 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 _ $6 - 3 _ $4 = $60.
>
> 4. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 _ $6 - 4 _ $4 = $80.
>
> 5. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 _ $6 - 5 _ $4 = $100.
>
> 6. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 _ $6 - 6 _ $4 = $120.
>
> 7. 1 boards, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 25 _ $6 - 7 _ $4 = $122.
>
> The highest profit was $122 after rotating the wheel 7 times.

**Example 3:**

> Input: customers = [3,4,0,5,1], boardingCost = 1, runningCost = 92
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation:
>
> 1. 3 customers arrive, 3 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 3 _ $1 - 1 _ $92 = -$89.
>
> 2. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 _ $1 - 2 _ $92 = -$177.
>
> 3. 0 customers arrive, 0 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 _ $1 - 3 _ $92 = -$269.
>
> 4. 5 customers arrive, 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 _ $1 - 4 _ $92 = -$357.
>
> 5. 1 customer arrives, 2 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 13 _ $1 - 5 _ $92 = -$447.
>
> The profit was never positive, so return -1.

**Constraints:**

- `n == customers.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= customers[i] <= 50`
- `1 <= boardingCost, runningCost <= 100`
