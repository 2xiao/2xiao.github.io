# [3100. Water Bottles II](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles-ii/)

## 题目

You are given two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`.

`numBottles` represents the number of full water bottles that you initially
have. In one operation, you can perform one of the following operations:

- Drink any number of full water bottles turning them into empty bottles.
- Exchange `numExchange` empty bottles with one full water bottle. Then, increase `numExchange` by one.

Note that you cannot exchange multiple batches of empty bottles for the same
value of `numExchange`. For example, if `numBottles == 3` and `numExchange ==
1`, you cannot exchange `3` empty water bottles for `3` full bottles.

Return _the**maximum** number of water bottles you can drink_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: numBottles = 13, numExchange = 6
>
> Output: 15
>
> Explanation: The table above shows the number of full water bottles, empty water bottles, the value of numExchange, and the number of bottles drunk.

**Example 2:**

> Input: numBottles = 10, numExchange = 3
>
> Output: 13
>
> Explanation: The table above shows the number of full water bottles, empty water bottles, the value of numExchange, and the number of bottles drunk.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numBottles <= 100 `
- `1 <= numExchange <= 100`
