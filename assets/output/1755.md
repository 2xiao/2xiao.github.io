# [1755. Closest Subsequence Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-subsequence-sum/)

## 题目

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements
is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's
elements is `sum`, then you want to **minimize the absolute difference**
`abs(sum - goal)`.

Return _the **minimum** possible value of_ `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some
elements **(possibly all or none)** of the original array.



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
> 
> This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.
> 
> The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3], goal = -7
> 
> Output: 7

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 40`
  * `-107 <= nums[i] <= 107`
  * `-109 <= goal <= 109`
