# [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence)

## 题目

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest
consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
    **Output:** 9
    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
