# [2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/keep-multiplying-found-values-by-two)

## 题目

You are given an array of integers `nums`. You are also given an integer
`original` which is the first number that needs to be searched for in `nums`.

You then do the following steps:

  1. If `original` is found in `nums`, **multiply** it by two (i.e., set `original = 2 * original`).
  2. Otherwise, **stop** the process.
  3. **Repeat** this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.

Return _the **final** value of _`original`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
    **Output:** 24
    **Explanation:** 
    - 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
    - 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
    - 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
    - 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** nums = [2,7,9], original = 4
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:**
    - 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= nums[i], original <= 1000`
