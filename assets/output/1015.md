# [1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/)

## 题目

Given a positive integer `k`, you need to find the **length** of the
**smallest** positive integer `n` such that `n` is divisible by `k`, and `n`
only contains the digit `1`.

Return _the **length** of _`n`. If there is no such `n`, return -1.

**Note:** `n` may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.



**Example 1:**

> Input: k = 1
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: k = 2
> 
> Output: -1
> 
> Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.

**Example 3:**

> Input: k = 3
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= 105`
