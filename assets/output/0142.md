# [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii)

## 题目

Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If
there is no cycle, return_`null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can
be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally,
`pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is
connected to ( **0-indexed** ). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that**
`pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.



**Example 1:**

    **Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
    **Output:** tail connects to node index 1
    **Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
    **Output:** tail connects to node index 0
    **Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
    

**Example 3:**

    **Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
    **Output:** no cycle
    **Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.
    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
  * `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
  * `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.



**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?
