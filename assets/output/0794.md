# [794. Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-tic-tac-toe-state/)

## 题目

Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a string array `board`, return `true` if and only
if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid
tic-tac-toe game.

The board is a `3 x 3` array that consists of characters `' '`, `'X'`, and
`'O'`. The `' '` character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

- Players take turns placing characters into empty squares `' '`.
- The first player always places `'X'` characters, while the second player always places `'O'` characters.
- `'X'` and `'O'` characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
- The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.

**Example 1:**

> Input: board = ["O "," "," "]
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: The first player always plays "X".

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe2-grid.jpg)

> Input: board = ["XOX"," X "," "]
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: Players take turns making moves.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe4-grid.jpg)

> Input: board = ["XOX","O O","XOX"]
>
> Output: true

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 3`
- `board[i].length == 3`
- `board[i][j]` is either `'X'`, `'O'`, or `' '`.
