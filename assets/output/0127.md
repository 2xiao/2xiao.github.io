# [127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder)

## 题目

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a
dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... ->
sk` such that:

  * Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
  * Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
  * `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`,
return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence**
from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord` _, or_`0` _if no such sequence exists._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
  * `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
  * `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
  * `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
  * `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
  * `beginWord != endWord`
  * All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.
