# [2423. Remove Letter To Equalize Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-letter-to-equalize-frequency)

## 题目

You are given a **0-indexed** string `word`, consisting of lowercase English
letters. You need to select **one** index and **remove** the letter at that
index from `word` so that the **frequency** of every letter present in `word`
is equal.

Return __`true` _if it is possible to remove one letter so that the frequency
of all letters in_`word` _are equal, and_`false` _otherwise_.

**Note:**

  * The **frequency** of a letter `x` is the number of times it occurs in the string.
  * You **must** remove exactly one letter and cannot choose to do nothing.



**Example 1:**

> Input: word = "abcc"
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: Select index 3 and delete it: word becomes "abc" and each character has a frequency of 1.

**Example 2:**

> Input: word = "aazz"
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: We must delete a character, so either the frequency of "a" is 1 and the frequency of "z" is 2, or vice versa. It is impossible to make all present letters have equal frequency.

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= word.length <= 100`
  * `word` consists of lowercase English letters only.
