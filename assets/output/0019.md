# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list)

## 题目

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the
list and return its head.



**Example 1:**

> Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
> 
> Output: [1,2,3,5]

**Example 2:**

> Input: head = [1], n = 1
> 
> Output: []

**Example 3:**

> Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
> 
> Output: [1]

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
  * `1 <= sz <= 30`
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
  * `1 <= n <= sz`



**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?
