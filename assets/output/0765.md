# [765. Couples Holding Hands](https://leetcode.com/problems/couples-holding-hands)

## 题目

There are `n` couples sitting in `2n` seats arranged in a row and want to hold
hands.

The people and seats are represented by an integer array `row` where `row[i]`
is the ID of the person sitting in the `ith` seat. The couples are numbered in
order, the first couple being `(0, 1)`, the second couple being `(2, 3)`, and
so on with the last couple being `(2n - 2, 2n - 1)`.

Return _the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by
side_. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and
switch seats.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** row = [0,2,1,3]
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** row = [3,2,0,1]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** All couples are already seated side by side.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `2n == row.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 30`
  * `n` is even.
  * `0 <= row[i] < 2n`
  * All the elements of `row` are **unique**.
