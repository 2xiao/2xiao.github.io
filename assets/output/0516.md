# [516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)

## 题目

Given a string `s`, find _the longest palindromic **subsequence** 's length
in_ `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "bbbab"
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "cbbd"
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
