# [2543. Check if Point Is Reachable](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-point-is-reachable)

## 题目

There exists an infinitely large grid. You are currently at point `(1, 1)`,
and you need to reach the point `(targetX, targetY)` using a finite number of
steps.

In one **step** , you can move from point `(x, y)` to any one of the following
points:

  * `(x, y - x)`
  * `(x - y, y)`
  * `(2 * x, y)`
  * `(x, 2 * y)`

Given two integers `targetX` and `targetY` representing the X-coordinate and
Y-coordinate of your final position, return `true` _if you can reach the point
from_ `(1, 1)` _using some number of steps, and_`false` _otherwise_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: targetX = 6, targetY = 9
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: It is impossible to reach (6,9) from (1,1) using any sequence of moves, so false is returned.

**Example 2:**

> Input: targetX = 4, targetY = 7
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: You can follow the path (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,4) -> (1,8) -> (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (4,7).

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= targetX, targetY <= 109`
