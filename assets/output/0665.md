# [665. Non-decreasing Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array)

## 题目

Given an array `nums` with `n` integers, your task is to check if it could
become non-decreasing by modifying **at most one element**.

We define an array is non-decreasing if `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` holds for
every `i` ( **0-based** ) such that (`0 <= i <= n - 2`).



**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [4,2,3]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [4,2,1]
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: You cannot get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one element.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 104`
  * `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
