# [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

## 题目

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative
integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order** , and each of their nodes
contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked
list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
number 0 itself.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)

> Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
> 
> Output: [7,0,8]
> 
> Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

**Example 2:**

> Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
> 
> Output: [0]

**Example 3:**

> Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
> 
> Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
  * It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
