# [541. Reverse String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii)

## 题目

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for
every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are
less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the
first `k` characters and leave the other as original.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
> 
> Output: "bacdfeg"

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
> 
> Output: "bacd"

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
  * `1 <= k <= 104`
