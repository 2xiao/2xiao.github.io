# [859. Buddy Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/buddy-strings/)

## 题目

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` _if you can swap two letters
in_`s` _so the result is equal to_`goal` _, otherwise, return_`false` _._

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such
that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `s[i]` and `s[j]`.

- For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.

**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.

**Example 3:**

> Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase letters.
