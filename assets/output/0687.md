# [687. Longest Univalue Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-univalue-path/)

## 题目

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the longest path,
where each node in the path has the same value_. This path may or may not pass
through the root.

**The length of the path** between two nodes is represented by the number of
edges between them.

**Example 1:**

> Input: root = [5,4,5,1,1,null,5]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: The shown image shows that the longest path of the same value (i.e. 5).

**Example 2:**

> Input: root = [1,4,5,4,4,null,5]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: The shown image shows that the longest path of the same value (i.e. 4).

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- The depth of the tree will not exceed `1000`.
