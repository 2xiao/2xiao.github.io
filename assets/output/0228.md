# [228. Summary Ranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges/)

## 题目

You are given a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`.

A **range** `[a,b]` is the set of all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive).

Return _the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover all the numbers in
the array exactly**_. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly
one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the
ranges but not in `nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

- `"a->b"` if `a != b`
- `"a"` if `a == b`

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
>
> Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
>
> Explanation: The ranges are:
>
> [0,2] --> "0->2"
>
> [4,5] --> "4->5"
>
> [7,7] --> "7"

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
>
> Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
>
> Explanation: The ranges are:
>
> [0,0] --> "0"
>
> [2,4] --> "2->4"
>
> [6,6] --> "6"
>
> [8,9] --> "8->9"

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 20`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- All the values of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
