# [3298. Count Substrings That Can Be Rearranged to Contain a String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-that-can-be-rearranged-to-contain-a-string-ii/)

## 题目

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`.

A string `x` is called **valid** if `x` can be rearranged to have `word2` as a
prefix.

Return the total number of **valid** substrings of `word1`.

**Note** that the memory limits in this problem are **smaller** than usual, so
you **must** implement a solution with a _linear_ runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 = "bcca", word2 = "abc"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The only valid substring is `"bcca"` which can be rearranged to `"abcc"`
having `"abc"` as a prefix.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 = "abcabc", word2 = "abc"

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:**

All the substrings except substrings of size 1 and size 2 are valid.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** word1 = "abcabc", word2 = "aaabc"

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length <= 10^6`
- `1 <= word2.length <= 10^4`
- `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.
