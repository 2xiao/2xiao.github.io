# [193. Valid Phone Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-phone-numbers/)

## 题目

Given a text file `file.txt` that contains a list of phone numbers (one per
line), write a one-liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following
two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or
trailing white spaces.

**Example:**

Assume that `file.txt` has the following content:

> 987-123-4567
>
> 123 456 7890
>
> (123) 456-7890

Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:

> 987-123-4567
>
> (123) 456-7890
