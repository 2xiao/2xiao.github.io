# [2335. Minimum Amount of Time to Fill Cups](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-amount-of-time-to-fill-cups/)

## 题目

You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. Every
second, you can either fill up `2` cups with **different** types of water, or
`1` cup of any type of water.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `amount` of length `3` where
`amount[0]`, `amount[1]`, and `amount[2]` denote the number of cold, warm, and
hot water cups you need to fill respectively. Return _the **minimum** number
of seconds needed to fill up all the cups_.



**Example 1:**

> Input: amount = [1,4,2]
> 
> Output: 4
> 
> Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:
> 
> Second 1: Fill up a cold cup and a warm cup.
> 
> Second 2: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
> 
> Second 3: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
> 
> Second 4: Fill up a warm cup.
> 
> It can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of seconds needed.

**Example 2:**

> Input: amount = [5,4,4]
> 
> Output: 7
> 
> Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:
> 
> Second 1: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.
> 
> Second 2: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
> 
> Second 3: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
> 
> Second 4: Fill up a warm cup, and a hot cup.
> 
> Second 5: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.
> 
> Second 6: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
> 
> Second 7: Fill up a hot cup.

**Example 3:**

> Input: amount = [5,0,0]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: Every second, we fill up a cold cup.

**Constraints:**

  * `amount.length == 3`
  * `0 <= amount[i] <= 100`
