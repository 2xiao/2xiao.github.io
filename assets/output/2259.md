# [2259. Remove Digit From Number to Maximize Result](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-digit-from-number-to-maximize-result/)

## 题目

You are given a string `number` representing a **positive integer** and a
character `digit`.

Return _the resulting string after removing **exactly one occurrence** of
_`digit` _from_`number` _such that the value of the resulting string in
**decimal** form is **maximized**_. The test cases are generated such that
`digit` occurs at least once in `number`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: number = "123", digit = "3"
> 
> Output: "12"
> 
> Explanation: There is only one '3' in "123". After removing '3', the result is "12".

**Example 2:**

> Input: number = "1231", digit = "1"
> 
> Output: "231"
> 
> Explanation: We can remove the first '1' to get "231" or remove the second '1' to get "123".
> 
> Since 231 > 123, we return "231".

**Example 3:**

> Input: number = "551", digit = "5"
> 
> Output: "51"
> 
> Explanation: We can remove either the first or second '5' from "551".
> 
> Both result in the string "51".

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= number.length <= 100`
  * `number` consists of digits from `'1'` to `'9'`.
  * `digit` is a digit from `'1'` to `'9'`.
  * `digit` occurs at least once in `number`.
