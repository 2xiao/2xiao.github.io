# [730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-different-palindromic-subsequences)

## 题目

Given a string s, return _the number of different non-empty palindromic
subsequences in_ `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo**
`109 + 7`.

A subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from
the string.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `a1, a2, ...` and `b1, b2, ...` are different if there is some
`i` for which `ai != bi`.



**Example 1:**

> Input: s = "bccb"
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.
> 
> Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.

**Example 2:**

> Input: s = "abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba"
> 
> Output: 104860361
> 
> Explanation: There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 109 + 7.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s[i]` is either `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, or `'d'`.
