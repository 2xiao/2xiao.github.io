# [1652. Defuse the Bomb](https://leetcode.com/problems/defuse-the-bomb)

## 题目

You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will
provide you with a **circular** array `code` of length of `n` and a key `k`.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are
replaced **simultaneously**.

  * If `k > 0`, replace the `ith` number with the sum of the **next** `k` numbers.
  * If `k < 0`, replace the `ith` number with the sum of the **previous** `k` numbers.
  * If `k == 0`, replace the `ith` number with `0`.

As `code` is circular, the next element of `code[n-1]` is `code[0]`, and the
previous element of `code[0]` is `code[n-1]`.

Given the **circular** array `code` and an integer key `k`, return _the
decrypted code to defuse the bomb_!



**Example 1:**

> Input: code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3
> 
> Output: [12,10,16,13]
> 
> Explanation: Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.

**Example 2:**

> Input: code = [1,2,3,4], k = 0
> 
> Output: [0,0,0,0]
> 
> Explanation: When k is zero, the numbers are replaced by 0. 

**Example 3:**

> Input: code = [2,4,9,3], k = -2
> 
> Output: [12,5,6,13]
> 
> Explanation: The decrypted code is [3+9, 2+3, 4+2, 9+4]. Notice that the numbers wrap around again. If k is negative, the sum is of the **previous** numbers.

**Constraints:**

  * `n == code.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `1 <= code[i] <= 100`
  * `-(n - 1) <= k <= n - 1`
