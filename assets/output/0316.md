Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once
and only once. You must make sure your result is **the smallest in
lexicographical order** among all possible results.



**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "cbacdcbc"
    **Output:** "acdb"
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
