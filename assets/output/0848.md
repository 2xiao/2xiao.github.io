# [848. Shifting Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/shifting-letters)

## 题目

You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and an integer array
`shifts` of the same length.

Call the `shift()` of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping
around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`).

  * For example, `shift('a') = 'b'`, `shift('t') = 'u'`, and `shift('z') = 'a'`.

Now for each `shifts[i] = x`, we want to shift the first `i + 1` letters of
`s`, `x` times.

Return _the final string after all such shifts to s are applied_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
    **Output:** "rpl"
    **Explanation:** We start with "abc".
    After shifting the first 1 letters of s by 3, we have "dbc".
    After shifting the first 2 letters of s by 5, we have "igc".
    After shifting the first 3 letters of s by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** s = "aaa", shifts = [1,2,3]
    **Output:** "gfd"
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
  * `shifts.length == s.length`
  * `0 <= shifts[i] <= 109`
