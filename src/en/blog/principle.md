# How to Make Important Life Decisions

<font color=gray>Published on 2019-05-08</font>

Recently, I went through a crucial life decision - starting a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend and planning to study abroad or find a job in a foreign country. Since then, my life has entered into a new layer of uncertainty.

Making the decision itself wasn't too agonizing because I had an option that I didn't need to think twice about. Everything felt like it fell into place effortlessly. However, when facing such a pivotal moment in life, the process of soul-searching is inevitable. So, I am recording here some beliefs to guide me in making life choices.

① First and foremost, life is genuinely tough, and hardship is a normal state. In Buddhism, there's a term called "impermanence," which refers to the constant state of change in things, the inability to exist eternally. This is also a theory accepted by dialectical materialists: all things in the world are in constant motion and change, and nothing is eternal and unchanging. Therefore, life is full of surprises and mistakes, which is the norm. Any luck and happiness are blessings and should be appreciated; none of them lasts.

② People need to transform themselves into good individuals (this goodness refers to self-love, self-acceptance, having their own system; how good specifically, I don't know for now, but I know that such a state does exist). Only under this necessary condition can one have good intimate relationships, good family relationships, good friends, a good career, and good works. This is a direction that needs long-term optimization. Many things in life cannot be rushed; take it slow.

③ Love is about spending time together, sincerity between each other, convergence of core values, tolerance for the ups and downs of life, and an infinite game.

④ Life is a series of experiences. When you finish reading a book, you are no longer the same person as when you read the first page. Life is the same. We encounter new things every day, gain a series of even conflicting feelings, such as joy and loss in gain, anger and attachment in disappointment, and sadness and anticipation in farewell. We call these collected feelings "experiences." These experiences shape our lives, constantly molding and refreshing who we are.

⑤ You can get almost anything you want, but you cannot get everything you want. This means you have to make choices. Choices mean giving up. All decisions are difficult, and all you have to do is make a decision and then make it right. Once you make a decision and work hard to stick with it, you will surely achieve your desires. Make a decision and then make it right. People are self-fulfilling prophecies.

⑥ I am extremely lucky.

⑦ For major and irreversible decisions, collect enough information to ensure making the right choice. Before reaching the threshold of information gathering, refrain from making judgments and decisions lightly. Look for opportunities with "asymmetric returns," which means opportunities where "failure has a low loss but success has a huge gain." Even better opportunities are those with "a bit of linear return if failed, but a huge exponential return if successful." Of course, such opportunities are very rare.

These beliefs are largely inspired by the podcasts of Zhang Xiaoyu, brofeng, and Jian Lili. Over the past couple of years, they have gradually internalized and become a part of me.

I am very lucky and grateful that, regardless of my choice, my friends and family are silently supporting me.

I also wish you, the one reading this article, courage and exceptionally good luck.
