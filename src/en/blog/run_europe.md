# Guide to Find Jobs in Europe

<font color=gray>Published on 2023-11-16</font>

I recently researched the situation of programmers finding jobs in Europe. Here's a summary for those interested.

If you want to understand the basics of Europe, such as visa policies, job opportunities, and salary levels, you can check out the [Europe Basic Knowledge Pop-up](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-824648-1-1.html) on 1point3acres.

There are also dedicated sections for different European countries where many people share and discuss. You can look for situations similar to yours:
