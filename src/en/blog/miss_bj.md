# Occasionally, I Still Miss Beijing

<font color=gray>Published on 2023-07-25</font>

I often find myself reminiscing about my life in Beijing, living alone with a cat in a cozy apartment.

Most weekends were spent at home, playing with my cat and sleeping until I naturally woke up.

Once rested, I'd take a taxi to the nearby mall, enjoy a meal at Hai Di Lao or Ba Heli, then visit Xixi Books or a jewelry store to buy rings and bracelets.

Of course, I haven't forgotten the loneliness and the challenges at work during that time.

But in certain aspects, life back then felt more liberating than it does now.

For example, the freedom of movement. It was convenient to go wherever I wanted in Beijing. In the U.S., everything requires a car. So, I have to wait for Chen Qingyang to have time and energy before I can go out. However, I recently discovered a bus that goes directly to Macy's.

In Beijing, I had my own house, my own cat, and the freedom to buy furniture and greenery to decorate it the way I liked. Now, here, because I always think I'll leave at the end of the year, I don't bother decorating. I'll leave it empty.

Moreover, since two kids came into the house, I've hardly had a good night's sleep. It's too noisy. Staying in a noisy environment for too long can be mentally exhausting.

And there's the downward mobility of the immigrant class, as I mentioned before. I used to earn tens of thousands a month even when slacking off. Now, I can only rely on savings. Extracting a bit of the housing fund at the beginning of each month is the only income.

In summary, quitting my job and coming to the U.S. gave me time freedom, ending the long-distance situation. However, I've also lost many things.

But it's okay. What's lost can be slowly rebuilt.

After all, there's no one else outside, and everything is the best arrangement.
