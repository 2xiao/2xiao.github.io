# Some Reflections on Returning to the Hometown

<font color=gray>Published on 2021-10-17</font>

During the National Day holiday, I visited home, and I'd like to share some reflections on the experience.

The first impression was that upon returning home, the rules of the world and the criteria for judging values seemed to have changed.

In a small town, making money is particularly challenging. No matter how hard you work, it doesn't make a significant difference, mainly because the economic pie is quite small.

- The lowest-income farmers (like my grandmother) lead very humble lives. Growing corn to feed pigs for self-sufficiency is considered decent. If there's extra, selling some tobacco and chili peppers might bring in a few thousand yuan a year. Families with more labor can earn 30,000 to 40,000 yuan at most.
- Working for others pays around 200 yuan a day, and considering rainy and snowy days, one can work a maximum of 200 days a year.
- Those who make a bit more money are involved in cultivating traditional Chinese medicine. With good yields, net profits can reach tens of thousands. However, after the drop in prices following the pandemic, life has become challenging for those involved in the industry, including my father and some acquaintances who buy and sell medicinal herbs.
- Civil servants, teachers, doctors, and bank employees are highly praised professions, and almost all my childhood friends who stayed in the hometown are either currently working in these fields or aiming to secure such positions. The intricacies of relationships within these fields are complicated, and social skills, such as treating others to meals, toasting during gatherings, and polite conversation, are crucial. Elderly people often discuss the achievements of someone's daughter who has secured a position or say, "So-and-so's daughter is excellent, having secured a permanent position; their family is blessed." I even received advice from a respected elder, "Why not try to become a civil servant? Although internet industry salaries are high, they are not stable."
- At the top of the social hierarchy are those engaged in construction and engineering work, like my aunt's husband. They are the true bourgeoisie, controlling the means of production, government information, and resources. The recent projects such as wind power, pumped storage, and sports stadiums have allowed them to earn millions. Some of my father's friends are also considering switching to engineering projects, with influential elders advising my uncle at a gathering, "You should establish good relations with your brother, who is a deputy county chief."

As a casual observer passing through, I found it fascinating that the hometown seems to be a microcosm of society, and the only difference lies in the size of the economic pie. While I'm used to focusing on a single screw in Beijing, I couldn't help but notice the broader game when I returned home, thanks to my parents' social connections, providing an opportunity to interact with people from various industries and social strata. Their beliefs and life experiences, along with the reminder that I can't go back to the past, made me realize that I could only return to my hometown as a child who hasn't grown up, a wandering child returning occasionally.

I also feel fortunate to have the chance to experience my family's love. Every morning, there's a warm breakfast waiting, and on one evening, walking home with my father and younger brother, the stars were exceptionally bright and numerous, the roads glistening like a galaxy in the moonlight. Studying English vocabulary and playing table tennis with my younger brother, who also posted the letters we wrote to him on the wall, were memorable moments. Visiting my grandparents and uncles, buying gifts for them, and inquiring about their health, as well as personally changing the smart lock for my parents and sending me off early in the morning whenever I left, are cherished memories.

Being at home made me feel like I had a tap of emotional energy that replenished my spirits whenever I turned it on.
