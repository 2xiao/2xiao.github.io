# A Small Incident on New Year's Day

<font color=gray>Published on 2022-01-01</font>

Happy New Year!

Today, I worked the whole day, isn't it miserable? Please type "太惨了" (so miserable) in the public chat!

In fact, every holiday is the most laborious time for me because there's triple pay during holidays. If you work for 12 hours, it's 4.5 times the regular pay. Working one day is equivalent to working an entire week. As a daily 996 company exploited worker, how could I miss this opportunity to work hard?

So even though today is New Year's Day, the company is still lively. Many colleagues, like me, came to work.

There's a girl who is relatively pitiful. Her overtime application was submitted too late, and the leader forgot to approve it, so her application didn't go through.

But she still came, hoping to see if she could sign in without approval. Unfortunately, the overtime system has restrictions, and she couldn't sign in.

However, since she came all the way, on the first day of the new year, she got up early, took a taxi to the company, and didn't want to go straight home. She stayed and worked overtime for 12 hours. She plans to try asking the secretary to retroactively sign in later.

When I left work, I asked her, "Have you had dinner?"

She said, "No, planning to wait until 9:30 to finish work and then go out with her husband to have something nice to celebrate."

I felt a bit sad when I heard this. Who wouldn't want to spend the first day of the new year happily eating delicious food with their family? But she could only stay in the company for 12 hours, her husband could only wait for her at home, and most importantly, working overtime might not even result in successful retroactive sign-in and getting paid.

But then I thought, didn't I also work 12 hours without having dinner? What qualifications do I have to sympathize with her?

At least, she has a husband waiting for her to finish work and eat out together. I can only hesitate about whether to go to the mall alone to eat something nice. It's not worth it. I'll just order takeout at home.

As the saying goes: rich in finance, poor in IT.

On the way home, the wind was particularly strong, cutting like a knife on my face.

I thought, our community doesn't allow delivery motorcycles to enter. So, the delivery guys can only get off and walk with the takeaway to my doorstep. It takes about 6 minutes for a round trip from the community gate to my house. One round is 12 minutes in total. This is obviously beyond the countdown budget of the takeaway app, so they usually run the entire way.

I felt a bit sad again. Who wouldn't want to spend the first day of the new year happily eating delicious food with their family? But the delivery guy has to brave the cold wind to deliver the takeaway. Moreover, the delivery fee for this order is only 4 yuan.

So, when I got home, I looked around to see if I had any gifts to give to this delivery guy.

Suddenly, I thought, a few days ago, I bought some WeChat red envelopes on PDD. When you open the red envelope, you can see a funny card. I put 20 yuan in it, and I intentionally folded it very, very small, hoping that when he opened it, he would think he was pranked.

With the red envelope ready, in no time, the delivery guy knocked on my door. I hurried to the door.

He shouted through the door: "I've left the food at your door!"

I quickly stopped him and said, "Wait, wait."

At this point, he had already moved quickly to the elevator.

I said, "I have something for you," and handed him the red envelope.

He asked, "What's this?"

I said, "A New Year's gift."

He smiled and said, "Thank you," then hurriedly turned around and pressed the elevator.

I chuckled a bit, closed the door, and stood at the door wearing a nightgown. It was still a bit cold.

Eating takeout while unable to help imagining what he would look like when he opened the red envelope, pranked at first, then warmed by a little kindness, made me feel especially happy.

In 2021, I learned a lesson: as an ordinary person, whether in a big city or a small town, whether in finance or IT, whether at school, a bank, or in the system, not a single person is living an easy life.
