# The Experience of Being a Digital Nomad

<font color=gray>Published on 2023-05-01</font>

Today, while cleaning, I listened to a podcast: ["01 Being a Digital Nomad in Bali, Not Working Is the Fast Lane to Making Money"](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/63e2661be99bdef7d3358c44?s=eyJ1IjoiNjA2MjgwZTRlMGY1ZTcyM2JiMTRlZDZiIn0%3D).

The host shared her transformation after becoming a digital nomad. She mentioned allowing herself to embrace the non-linear aspects of life, permitting one or two years for adjustment and accumulation, instead of the constant pressure for increasing income and job promotions every year.

I suddenly realized that resigning from my job brought about a significant change â€“ I let go of the concept of "career planning." Previously, I always felt the need to carefully plan each step for a good-looking resume, considering promotions and job changes. I also feared that during interviews, HR would be concerned about any gaps in my employment history.

Perhaps this thinking was limited, trapped in conventional notions. I used to believe I would return to the companies where I had previously worked. But now, that seems impossible. It appears my future will either involve being a digital nomad working remotely or joining a company that doesn't care about employment gaps and values work-life balance.

A universal arbitrage principle suggests that instead of getting caught up in a limited game, it's better to go to a place with a bigger cake and abundant resources and casually explore. Humans don't exist solely to craft an impressive resume. Even if one becomes a corporate elite with an appealing resume, what does it truly signify? It's just a part of the hierarchy of needs, and individuals must confront higher-level needs and the myriad demands at the base of the pyramid.

Some takeaways from listening to this podcast:

- Most freelancers are in a situation where they spend their savings while quietly withdrawing provident fund contributions, a harsh but realistic scenario.

- The desire to earn money should be pure; it cannot be both altruistic and selfish. Wanting to do meaningful work, making money, and seeking admiration from friends are conflicting desires. Making money is about making money.

- When the savings run out, you naturally find ways to make money.

- Wishful thinking rule: Only allow 1.5 wishes at a time.

- Community is essential. Being around like-minded people and interacting with those who are adept at making money is crucial.

- Living expenses in Bali: A decent homestay costs around a hundred a day, with monthly expenses totaling five or six thousand.

- Operating your own website is vital. If you open a shop, have a menu. Clearly articulate to others what services you can provide if you want to take on projects.

- Being a digital nomad is not easy; unlike a job where you can slack off, digital nomads must take responsibility for their businesses.

- The three dimensions of freedom: geographical freedom, time freedom, financial freedom.
