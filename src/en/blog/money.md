# My Relationship with Money

<font color=gray>Published on 2021-08-29</font>

Recently, I listened to a podcast where a guest shared her life goal: to save 500,000 RMB before the age of 55. It sounded pitiful and absurd—people tend to set funny goals for themselves, thinking that life will be different once the goal is achieved. In reality, such goals become obstacles, hindering you from experiencing the depth and boundaries of life.

However, I used to be like that too. At the time, I was determined to reunite with my boyfriend in the United States. Every day, I clutched a calculator, calculating how many more months of work it would take to save enough for my study abroad expenses. I lived frugally, in survival mode.

Then the pandemic hit, and my plans to go abroad went down the drain. Since I couldn't reunite with him, I thought about buying a house in Beijing, decorating it in my favorite style, and giving myself a safe and comfortable home. However, after checking the housing market on Lianjia, I realized my limited funds were like a drop in the ocean compared to the soaring property prices in Beijing. Even if I forced my way in, I would have to borrow 700,000 RMB interest-free from the company, further entangling myself.

This situation is like a set of Russian dolls. Life isn't happy, so you work hard to earn money to buy a house, thinking that buying a house will make everything better. Instead, you find yourself even more bound and less free and happy due to the burden of loans.

So, I changed my goal again. I thought about earning money to make my family's life happier and more joyful. For example, I wanted to provide better education for my nephew, buy some quality items to improve my parents' quality of life, and give red envelopes to my grandmother. However, reality once again threw a bucket of cold water on me. I couldn't change my nephew's education model, a phone call every few weeks couldn't compete with the daily influence of my mom and his teachers, and bringing him to live with me in a big city wasn't realistic. After all, his parents are his legal guardians. Moreover, during last year's Chinese New Year, I found that I couldn't make my family happier because they weren't lacking in material goods. Their life propositions—intimate relationships, the original family, life meaning, impermanence, and death—could only be faced and resolved by them. As a junior family member, I couldn't fathom their life experiences, and even basic listening and empathy were challenging.

Realizing that money, or at least the rate at which I currently earn it, can't solve any of my core needs at this stage, I feel very nihilistic. I go to work every day, not for any specific goal, because I know that besides the increasing balance in my bank account, nothing changes. 

Following the definition in [this article](https://youzhiyouxing.cn/n/materials/875), I am still at the end of the first stage—the "survival stage"—and far from reaching the second stage—"freedom."

**At what point, in terms of salary, do you feel secure enough? Is it when you no longer rely on your salary for living expenses and can save some money each month? If so, how much savings do you need to feel at ease? 10,000? 50,000? 100,000?**

**When you live with a "survival mentality," you always worry. Regardless of whether it's 10,000 or 100,000, everything you have is not enough to offset the fear in your heart.**

**If you continue to live with a "survival mentality," even if the risk is minimal, you will be afraid to do anything with uncertainty, such as changing jobs, getting a promotion, changing industries, or resigning.**

Ironically, although the current situation is not satisfactory, I still can't make a change. I wake up every day and dive into the muddled situation, maintaining the status quo. As mentioned above, I fear the fear brought by uncertainty.

One day, I worked overtime until my heart felt uncomfortable. My boyfriend advised me that although I might not have better choices for now, from a survival perspective, I am completely free. No one is holding a knife to my throat, forcing me to go to work. Quitting my job wouldn't make me starve to death. It really wasn't worth continuing a job that harmed my body and wasted my life.

He also said that whether a person is free or not is not determined by how much money they earn but by whether they have the confidence to find the next job and, more importantly, realizing that what they have is already "enough."

**It is extremely, extremely, extremely not cost-effective to cause irreversible damage to your body just to earn some wages. Maintaining basic physical fitness, liberating time for rich cognition and awareness, and waiting for some kind of social paradigm and technological singularity to arrive for flexible integration into a new ecological position are the right way for us ordinary people to develop in the long term.**
