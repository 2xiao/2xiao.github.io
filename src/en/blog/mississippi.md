# Mississippi Road Trip

<font color=gray>Published on 2023-08-03</font>

This weekend, I went to Mississippi to accompany relatives looking at houses.

Mississippi is considered one of the poorest states in the U.S., so the cost of living is relatively low.

Of course, the prices of meat, eggs, and dairy are similar to those in big cities, but the significant difference lies in housing prices.

I think a comparable region in China would be Nanning in Guangxi—coastal, good climate, and low housing prices.

This time, we stayed at an Airbnb, a townhouse by the beach. Including service fees and cleaning fees, it cost around 1300 RMB per night.

Checking the host's profile, she manages 15 townhouses for Airbnb. Just in the neighborhood we stayed in, she owns five.

Looking at real estate prices on Zillow, a similar house—two floors, about 120 square meters, 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, with a backyard—sells for around $200,000.

The area is convenient, with a five-minute walk to the beach, and within a five-minute drive, there's Walmart, McDonald's, and various restaurants.

I also checked the rental apartments in the area. In a more sophisticated community, a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment rents for around $850 per month—half the price of Atlanta.

I've noticed that whether living in a small coastal city like Gulfport or a large southern city like Atlanta, Americans have similar lifestyles. They opt for suburban living, a large house, and drive to the supermarket for groceries. The only difference is that small cities don't have Costco and Whole Foods.

So, if there are no considerations for education and work, buying a beachfront villa in Mississippi sounds fantastic.

Another pleasant surprise was finding jambalaya, a sausage and meat sauce rice dish I had in Texas, at a Cajun restaurant. Indeed, places near Mexico have a variety of delicious food.
