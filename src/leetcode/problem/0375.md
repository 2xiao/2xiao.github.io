## 题目

We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:

1. I pick a number between `1` and `n`.
2. You guess a number.
3. If you guess the right number, **you win the game**.
4. If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is **higher or lower** , and you will continue guessing.
5. Every time you guess a wrong number `x`, you will pay `x` dollars. If you run out of money, **you lose the game**.

Given a particular `n`, return _the minimum amount of money you need to
**guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick**_.

**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 10
>
> Output: 16
>
> Explanation: The winning strategy is as follows:
>
> - The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.
>
> - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.
>
> - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.
>
>   - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.
>
>   - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
>
>   - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
>
> - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.
>
>   - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.
>
>   - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.
>
>     - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.
>
>     - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
>
>     - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
>
>   - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.
>
>     - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
>
>     - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.
>
> The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 1
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 2
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.
>
> - Guess 1.
>
>   - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.
>
>   - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.
>
> The worst case is that you pay $1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 200`

## 题目大意

我们正在玩一个猜数游戏，游戏规则如下：

1. 我从 `1` 到 `n` 之间选择一个数字。
2. 你来猜我选了哪个数字。
3. 如果你猜到正确的数字，就会 **赢得游戏** 。
4. 如果你猜错了，那么我会告诉你，我选的数字比你的 **更大或者更小** ，并且你需要继续猜数。
5. 每当你猜了数字 `x` 并且猜错了的时候，你需要支付金额为 `x` 的现金。如果你花光了钱，就会 输掉游戏 。

给你一个特定的数字 `n` ，返回能够 **确保你获胜** 的最小现金数，**不管我选择那个数字** 。
